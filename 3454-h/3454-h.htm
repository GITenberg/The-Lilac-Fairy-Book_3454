    <h2>
      Preface
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What cases are you engaged in at present?&rsquo; &lsquo;Are you stopping many teeth
      just now?&rsquo; &lsquo;What people have you converted lately?&rsquo; Do ladies put these
      questions to the men&mdash;lawyers, dentists, clergymen, and so forth&mdash;who
      happen to sit next them at dinner parties?
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not know whether ladies thus indicate their interest in the
      occupations of their casual neighbours at the hospitable board. But if
      they do not know me, or do not know me well, they generally ask &lsquo;Are you
      writing anything now?&rsquo; (as if they should ask a painter &lsquo;Are you painting
      anything now?&rsquo; or a lawyer &lsquo;Have you any cases at present?&rsquo;). Sometimes
      they are more definite and inquire &lsquo;What are you writing now?&rsquo; as if I
      must be writing something&mdash;which, indeed, is the case, though I
      dislike being reminded of it. It is an awkward question, because the fair
      being does not care a bawbee what I am writing; nor would she be much
      enlightened if I replied &lsquo;Madam, I am engaged on a treatise intended to
      prove that Normal is prior to Conceptional Totemism&rsquo;&mdash;though that
      answer would be as true in fact as obscure in significance. The best plan
      seems to be to answer that I have entirely abandoned mere literature, and
      am contemplating a book on &lsquo;The Causes of Early Blight in the Potato,&rsquo; a
      melancholy circumstance which threatens to deprive us of our chief
      esculent root. The inquirer would never be undeceived. One nymph who, like
      the rest, could not keep off the horrid topic of my occupation, said &lsquo;You
      never write anything but fairy books, do you?&rsquo; A French gentleman, too, an
      educationist and expert in portraits of Queen Mary, once sent me a
      newspaper article in which he had written that I was exclusively devoted
      to the composition of fairy books, and nothing else. He then came to
      England, visited me, and found that I knew rather more about portraits of
      Queen Mary than he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth I never did write any fairy books in my life, except &lsquo;Prince
      Prigio,&rsquo; &lsquo;Prince Ricardo,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Tales from a Fairy Court&rsquo;&mdash;that of
      the aforesaid Prigio. I take this opportunity of recommending these fairy
      books&mdash;poor things, but my own&mdash;to parents and guardians who may
      never have heard of them. They are rich in romantic adventure, and the
      Princes always marry the right Princesses and live happy ever afterwards;
      while the wicked witches, stepmothers, tutors and governesses are never
      cruelly punished, but retire to the country on ample pensions. I hate
      cruelty: I never put a wicked stepmother in a barrel and send her
      tobogganing down a hill. It is true that Prince Ricardo did kill the
      Yellow Dwarf; but that was in fair fight, sword in hand, and the dwarf,
      peace to his ashes! died in harness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object of these confessions is not only that of advertising my own
      fairy books (which are not &lsquo;out of print&rsquo;; if your bookseller says so, the
      truth is not in him), but of giving credit where credit is due. The fairy
      books have been almost wholly the work of Mrs. Lang, who has translated
      and adapted them from the French, German, Portuguese, Italian, Spanish,
      Catalan, and other languages.
    </p>
    <p>
      My part has been that of Adam, according to Mark Twain, in the Garden of
      Eden. Eve worked, Adam superintended. I also superintend. I find out where
      the stories are, and advise, and, in short, superintend. I do not write
      the stories out of my own head. The reputation of having written all the
      fairy books (an European reputation in nurseries and the United States of
      America) is &lsquo;the burden of an honour unto which I was not born.&rsquo; It weighs
      upon and is killing me, as the general fash of being the wife of the Lord
      of Burleigh, Burleigh House by Stamford Town, was too much for the village
      maiden espoused by that peer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody really wrote most of the stories. People told them in all parts of
      the world long before Egyptian hieroglyphics or Cretan signs or Cyprian
      syllabaries, or alphabets were invented. They are older than reading and
      writing, and arose like wild flowers before men had any education to
      quarrel over. The grannies told them to the grandchildren, and when the
      grandchildren became grannies they repeated the same old tales to the new
      generation. Homer knew the stories and made up the &lsquo;Odyssey&rsquo; out of half a
      dozen of them. All the history of Greece till about 800 B.C. is a string
      of the fairy tales, all about Theseus and Heracles and Oedipus and Minos
      and Perseus is a Cabinet des Fes, a collection of fairy tales. Shakespeare
      took them and put bits of them into &lsquo;King Lear&rsquo; and other plays; he could
      not have made them up himself, great as he was. Let ladies and gentlemen
      think of this when they sit down to write fairy tales, and have them
      nicely typed, and send them to Messrs. Longman &amp; Co. to be published.
      They think that to write a new fairy tale is easy work. They are mistaken:
      the thing is impossible. Nobody can write a new fairy tale; you can only
      mix up and dress up the old, old stories, and put the characters into new
      dresses, as Miss Thackeray did so well in &lsquo;Five Old Friends.&rsquo; If any big
      girl of fourteen reads this preface, let her insist on being presented
      with &lsquo;Five Old Friends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the three hundred and sixty-five authors who try to write new fairy
      tales are very tiresome. They always begin with a little boy or girl who
      goes out and meets the fairies of polyanthuses and gardenias and apple
      blossoms: &lsquo;Flowers and fruits, and other winged things.&rsquo; These fairies try
      to be funny, and fail; or they try to preach, and succeed. Real fairies
      never preach or talk slang. At the end, the little boy or girl wakes up
      and finds that he has been dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such are the new fairy stories. May we be preserved from all the sort of
      them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Our stories are almost all old, some from Ireland, before that island was
      as celebrated for her wrongs as for her verdure; some from Asia, made, I
      dare say, before the Aryan invasion; some from Moydart, Knoydart, Morar
      and Ardnamurchan, where the sea streams run like great clear rivers and
      the saw-edged hills are blue, and men remember Prince Charlie. Some are
      from Portugal, where the golden fruits grow in the Garden of the
      Hesperides; and some are from wild Wales, and were told at Arthur&rsquo;s Court;
      and others come from the firesides of the kinsmen of the Welsh, the
      Bretons. There are also modern tales by a learned Scandinavian named
      Topelius.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the stories were translated or adapted by Mrs. Lang, except &lsquo;The
      Jogi&rsquo;s Punishment&rsquo; and &lsquo;Moti,&rsquo; done by Major Campbell out of the Pushtoo
      language; &lsquo;How Brave Walter hunted Wolves,&rsquo; which, with &lsquo;Little Lasse&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;The Raspberry Worm,&rsquo; was done from Topelius by Miss Harding; and &lsquo;The Sea
      King&rsquo;s Gift,&rsquo; by Miss Christie, from the same author.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been suggested to the Editor that children and parents and
      guardians would like &lsquo;The Grey True Ghost-Story Book.&rsquo; He knows that the
      children would like it well, and he would gladly give it to them; but
      about the taste of fond anxious mothers and kind aunts he is not quite so
      certain. Before he was twelve the Editor knew true ghost stories enough to
      fill a volume. They were a pure joy till bedtime, but then, and later,
      were not wholly a source of unmixed pleasure. At that time the Editor was
      not afraid of the dark, for he thought, &lsquo;If a ghost is here, we can&rsquo;t see
      him.&rsquo; But when older and better informed persons said that ghosts brought
      their own light with them (which is too true), then one&rsquo;s emotions were
      such as parents do not desire the young to endure. For this reason &lsquo;The
      Grey True Ghost-Story Book&rsquo; is never likely to be illustrated by Mr. Ford.

    <h2>
      The Shifty Lad
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the land of Erin there dwelt long ago a widow who had an only son. He
      was a clever boy, so she saved up enough money to send him to school, and,
      as soon as he was old enough, to apprentice him to any trade that he would
      choose. But when the time came, he said he would not be bound to any
      trade, and that he meant to be a thief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now his mother was very sorrowful when she heard of this, but she knew
      quite well that if she tried to stop his having his own way he would only
      grow more determined to get it. So all the answer she made was that the
      end of thieves was hanging at the bridge of Dublin, and then she left him
      alone, hoping that when he was older he might become more sensible.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day she was going to church to hear a sermon from a great preacher,
      and she begged the Shifty Lad, as the neighbours called him from the
      tricks he played, to come with her. But he only laughed and declared that
      he did not like sermons, adding:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;However, I will promise you this, that the first trade you hear named
      after you come out from church shall be my trade for the rest of my life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These words gave a little comfort to the poor woman, and her heart was
      lighter than before as she bade him farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Shifty Lad thought that the hour had nearly come for the sermon
      to be over, he hid himself in some bushes in a little path that led
      straight to his mother&rsquo;s house, and, as she passed along, thinking of all
      the good things she had heard, a voice shouted close to her ear &lsquo;Robbery!
      Robbery! Robbery!&rsquo; The suddenness of it made her jump. The naughty boy had
      managed to change his voice, so that she did not know it for his, and he
      had concealed himself so well that, though she peered about all round her,
      she could see no one. As soon as she had turned the corner the Shifty Lad
      came out, and by running very fast through the wood he contrived to reach
      home before his mother, who found him stretched out comfortably before the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, have you got any news to tell me?&rsquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, nothing; for I left the church at once, and did not stop to speak to
      anyone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, then no one has mentioned a trade to you?&rsquo; he said in tones of
      disappointment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye&mdash;es,&rsquo; she replied slowly. &lsquo;At least, as I walked down the path a
      voice cried out &ldquo;Robbery! Robbery! Robbery!&rdquo; but that was all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And quite enough too,&rsquo; answered the boy. &lsquo;What did I tell you? That is
      going to be my trade.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then your end will be hanging at the bridge of Dublin,&rsquo; said she. But
      there was no sleep for her that night, for she lay in the dark thinking
      about her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he is to be a thief at all, he had better be a good one. And who is
      there that can teach him?&rsquo; the mother asked herself. But an idea came to
      her, and she arose early, before the sun was up, and set off for the home
      of the Black Rogue, or Gallows Bird, who was such a wonderful thief that,
      though all had been robbed by him, no one could catch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-morning to you,&rsquo; said the woman as she reached the place where the
      Black Gallows Bird lived when he was not away on his business. &lsquo;My son has
      a fancy to learn your trade. Will you be kind enough to teach him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he is clever, I don&rsquo;t mind trying,&rsquo; answered the Black Gallows Bird;
      &lsquo;and, of course, if ANY one can turn him into a first-rate thief, it is I.
      But if he is stupid, it is of no use at all; I can&rsquo;t bear stupid people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, he isn&rsquo;t stupid,&rsquo; said the woman with a sigh. &lsquo;So to-night, after
      dark, I will send him to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Shifty Lad jumped for joy when his mother told him where she had been.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will become the best thief in all Erin!&rsquo; he cried, and paid no heed
      when his mother shook her head and murmured something about &lsquo;the bridge of
      Dublin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Every evening after dark the Shifty Lad went to the home of the Black
      Gallows Bird, and many were the new tricks he learned. By-and-by he was
      allowed to go out with the Bird and watch him at work, and at last there
      came a day when his master though that he had grown clever enough to help
      in a big robbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a rich farmer up there on the hill, who has just sold all his
      fat cattle for much money and has bought some lean ones which will cost
      him little. Now it happens that, while he has received the money for the
      fat cattle, he has not yet paid the price of the thin ones, which he has
      in the cowhouse. To-morrow he will go to the market with the money in his
      hand, so to-night we must get at the chest. When all is quiet we will hide
      in the loft.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no moon, and it was the night of Hallowe&rsquo;en, and everyone was
      burning nuts and catching apples in a tub of water with their hands tied,
      and playing all sorts of other games, till the Shifty Lad grew quite tired
      of waiting for them to get to bed. The Black Gallows Bird, who was more
      accustomed to the business, tucked himself up on the hay and went to
      sleep, telling the boy to wake him when the merry-makers had departed. But
      the Shifty Lad, who could keep still no longer, crept down to the cowshed
      and loosened the heads of the cattle which were tied, and they began to
      kick each other and bellow, and made such a noise that the company in the
      farmhouse ran out to tie them up again. Then the Shifty Lad entered the
      room and picked up a big handful of nuts, and returned to the loft, where
      the Black Rogue was still sleeping. At first the Shifty Lad shut his eyes
      too, but very soon he sat up, and taking a big needle and thread from his
      pocket, he sewed the hem of the Black Gallows Bird&rsquo;s coat to a heavy piece
      of bullock&rsquo;s hide that was hanging at his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the cattle were all tied up again, but as the people could
      not find their nuts they sat round the fire and began to tell stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will crack a nut,&rsquo; said the Shifty Lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall not,&rsquo; cried the Black Gallows Bird; &lsquo;they will hear you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care,&rsquo; answered the Shifty Lad. &lsquo;I never spend Hallowe&rsquo;en yet
      without cracking a nut&rsquo;; and he cracked one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some one is cracking nuts up there,&rsquo; said one of the merry-makers in the
      farmhouse. &lsquo;Come quickly, and we will see who it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke loudly, and the Black Gallows Bird heard, and ran out of the
      loft, dragging the big leather hide after him which the Shifty Lad had
      sewed to his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is stealing my hide!&rsquo; shouted the farmer, and they all darted after
      him; but he was too swift for them, and at last he managed to tear the
      hide from his coat, and then he flew like a hare till he reached his old
      hiding-place. But all this took a long time, and meanwhile the Shifty Lad
      got down from the loft, and searched the house till he found the chest
      with the gold and silver in it, concealed behind a load of straw and
      covered with loaves of bread and a great cheese. The Shifty Lad slung the
      money bags round his shoulders and took the bread and the cheese under his
      arm, then set out quietly for the Black Rogue&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here you are at last, you villain!&rsquo; cried his master in great wrath. &lsquo;But
      I will be revenged on you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is all right,&rsquo; replied the Shifty Lad calmly. &lsquo;I have brought what you
      wanted&rsquo;; and he laid the things he was carrying down on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you are the better thief,&rsquo; said the Black Rogue&rsquo;s wife; and the Black
      Rogue added:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it is you who are the clever boy&rsquo;; and they divided the spoil and
      the Black Gallows Bird had one half and the Shifty Lad the other half.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few weeks after that the Black Gallows Bird had news of a wedding that
      was to be held near the town; and the bridegroom had many friends and
      everybody sent him a present. Now a rich farmer who lived up near the moor
      thought that nothing was so useful to a young couple when they first began
      to keep house as a fine fat sheep, so he bade his shepherd go off to the
      mountain where the flock were feeding, and bring him back the best he
      could find. And the shepherd chose out the largest and fattest of the
      sheep and the one with the whitest fleece; then he tied its feet together
      and put it across his shoulder, for he had a long way to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day, the Shifty Lad happened to be wandering over the moor, when he
      saw the man with the sheep on his shoulder walking along the road which
      led past the Black Rogue&rsquo;s house. The sheep was heavy and the man was in
      no hurry, so he came slowly and the boy knew that he himself could easily
      get back to his master before the shepherd was even in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will wager,&rsquo; he cried, as he pushed quickly through the bushes which
      hid the cabin&mdash;&lsquo;I will wager that I will steal the sheep from the man
      that is coming before he passes here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you indeed?&rsquo; said the Gallows Bird. &lsquo;I will wager you a hundred
      silver pieces that you can do nothing of the sort.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I will try it, anyway,&rsquo; replied the boy, and disappeared in the
      bushes. He ran fast till he entered a wood through which the shepherd must
      go, and then he stopped, and taking off one of his shoes smeared it with
      mud and set it in the path. When this was done he slipped behind a rock
      and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon the man came up, and seeing the shoe lying there, he stooped and
      looked at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a good shoe,&rsquo; he said to himself, &lsquo;but very dirty. Still, if I had
      the fellow, I would be at the trouble of cleaning it&rsquo;; so he threw the
      shoe down again and went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Shifty Lad smiled as he heard him, and, picking up the shoe, he crept
      round by a short way and laid the other shoe on the path. A few minutes
      after the shepherd arrived, and beheld the second shoe lying on the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, that is the fellow of the dirty shoe!&rsquo; he exclaimed when he saw it.
      &lsquo;I will go back and pick up the other one, and then I shall have a pair of
      good shoes,&rsquo; and he put the sheep on the grass and returned to fetch the
      shoe. Then the Shifty Lad put on his shoes, and, picking up the sheep,
      carried it home. And the Black Rogue paid him the hundred marks of his
      wager.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the shepherd reached the farmhouse that night he told his tale to his
      master, who scolded him for being stupid and careless, and bade him go the
      next day to the mountain and fetch him a kid, and he would send that as a
      wedding gift. But the Shifty Lad was on the look-out, and hid himself in
      the wood, and the moment the man drew near with the kid on his shoulders
      began to bleat like a sheep, and no one, not even the sheep&rsquo;s own mother,
      could have told the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it must have got its feet loose, and have strayed after all,&rsquo; 
      thought the man; and he put the kid on the grass and hurried off in the
      direction of the bleating. Then the boy ran back and picked up the kid,
      and took it to the Black Gallows Bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      The shepherd could hardly believe his eyes when he returned from seeking
      the sheep and found that the kid had vanished. He was afraid to go home
      and tell the same tale that he had told yesterday; so he searched the wood
      through and through till night was nearly come. Then he felt that there
      was no help for it, and he must go home and confess to his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the farmer was very angry at this second misfortune; but this
      time he told him to drive one of the big bulls from the mountain, and
      warned him that if he lost THAT he would lose his place also. Again the
      Shifty Lad, who was on the watch, perceived him pass by, and when he saw
      the man returning with the great bull he cried to the Black Rogue:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be quick and come into the wood, and we will try to get the bull also.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how can we do that?&rsquo; asked the Black Rogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, quite easily! You hide yourself out there and baa like a sheep, and I
      will go in the other direction and bleat like a kid. It will be all right,
      I assure you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The shepherd was walking slowly, driving the bull before him, when he
      suddenly heard a loud baa amongst the bushes far away on one side of the
      path, and a feeble bleat answering it from the other side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it must be the sheep and the kid that I lost,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Yes, surely
      it must&rsquo;; and tying the bull hastily to a tree, he went off after the
      sheep and the kid, and searched the wood till he was tired. Of course by
      the time he came back the two thieves had driven the bull home and killed
      him for meat, so the man was obliged to go to his master and confess that
      he had been tricked again.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this the Black Rogue and the Shifty Lad grew bolder and bolder, and
      stole great quantities of cattle and sold them and grew quite rich. One
      day they were returning from the market with a large sum of money in their
      pockets when they passed a gallows erected on the top of a hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us stop and look at that gallows,&rsquo; exclaimed the Shifty Lad. &lsquo;I have
      never seen one so close before. Yet some say that it is the end of all
      thieves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no one in sight, and they carefully examined every part of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder how it feels to be hanged,&rsquo; said the Shifty Lad. &lsquo;I should like
      to know, in case they ever catch me. I&rsquo;ll try first, and then you can do
      so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he fastened the loose cord about his neck, and when it was
      quite secure he told the Black Rogue to take the other end of the rope and
      draw him up from the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I am tired of it I will shake my legs, and then you must let me
      down,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Black Rogue drew up the rope, but in half a minute the Shifty Lad&rsquo;s
      legs began to shake, and he quickly let it down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t imagine what a funny feeling hanging gives you,&rsquo; murmured the
      Shifty Lad, who looked rather purple in the face and spoke in an odd
      voice. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think you have every tried it, or you wouldn&rsquo;t have let me
      go up first. Why, it is the pleasantest thing I have ever done. I was
      shaking my legs from sheer delight, and if you had been there you would
      have shaken your legs too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, let me try, if it is so nice,&rsquo; answered the Black Rogue. &lsquo;But be
      sure you tie the knot securely, for I don&rsquo;t want to fall down and break my
      neck.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I will see to that!&rsquo; replied the Shifty Lad. &lsquo;When you are tired,
      just whistle, and I&rsquo;ll let you down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Black Rogue was drawn up, and as soon as he was as high as the rope
      would allow him to go the Shifty Lad called to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t forest to whistle when you want to come down; but if you are
      enjoying yourself as I did, shake your legs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And in a moment the Black Rogue&rsquo;s legs began to shake and to kick, and the
      Shifty Lad stood below, watching him and laughing heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, how funny you are! If you could only see yourself! Oh, you ARE funny!
      But when you have had enough, whistle and you shall be let down&rsquo;; and he
      rocked again with laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no whistle came, and soon the legs ceased to shake and to kick, for
      the Black Gallows Bird was dead, as the Shifty Lad intended he should be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went home to the Black Rogue&rsquo;s wife, and told her that her husband
      was dead, and that he was ready to marry her if she liked. But the woman
      had been fond of the Black Rogue, thief though he was, and she shrank from
      the Shifty Lad in horror, and set the people after him, and he had to fly
      to another part of the country where none knew of his doings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps if the Shifty Lad&rsquo;s mother knew anything of this, she may have
      thought that by this time her son might be tired of stealing, and ready to
      try some honest trade. But in reality he loved the tricks and danger, and
      life would have seemed very dull without them. So he went on just as
      before, and made friends whom he taught to be as wicked as himself, till
      they took to robbing the king&rsquo;s storehouses, and by the advice of the Wise
      Man the king sent out soldiers to catch the band of thieves.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long while they tried in vain to lay hands on them. The Shifty Lad
      was too clever for them all, and if they laid traps he laid better ones.
      At last one night he stole upon some soldiers while they were asleep in a
      barn and killed them, and persuaded the villagers that if THEY did not
      kill the other soldiers before morning they would certainly be killed
      themselves. Thus it happened that when the sun rose not a single soldier
      was alive in the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course this news soon reached the king&rsquo;s ears, and he was very angry,
      and summoned the Wise Man to take counsel with him. And this was the
      counsel of the Wise Man&mdash;that he should invite all the people in the
      countryside to a ball, and among them the bold and impudent thief would be
      sure to come, and would be sure to ask the king&rsquo;s daughter to dance with
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your counsel is good,&rsquo; said the king, who made his feast and prepared for
      his ball; and all the people of the countryside were present, and the
      Shifty Lad came with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      When everyone had eaten and drunk as much as they wanted they went into
      the ballroom. There was a great throng, and while they were pressing
      through the doorway the Wise Man, who had a bottle of black ointment
      hidden in his robes, placed a tiny dot on the cheek of the Shifty Lad near
      his ear. The Shifty Lad felt nothing, but as he approached the king&rsquo;s
      daughter to ask her to be his partner he caught sight of the black dot in
      a silver mirror. Instantly he guessed who had put it there and why, but he
      said nothing, and danced so beautifully that the princess was quite
      delighted with him. At the end of the dance he bowed low to his partner
      and left her, to mingle with the crowd that was filling the doorway. As he
      passed the Wise Man he contrived not only to steal the bottle but to place
      two black dots on his face, and one on the faces of twenty other men. Then
      he slipped the bottle back in the Wise Man&rsquo;s robe.
    </p>
    <p>
      By-and-by he went up to the king&rsquo;s daughter again, and begged for the
      honour of another dance. She consented, and while he was stooping to tie
      the ribbons on his shoe she took out from her pocket another bottle, which
      the Wizard had given her, and put a black dot on his cheek. But she was
      not as skilful as the Wise Man, and the Shifty Lad felt the touch of her
      fingers; so as soon as the dance was over he contrived to place a second
      black dot on the faces of the twenty men and two more on the Wizard, after
      which he slipped the bottle into her pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the ball came to an end, and then the king ordered all the doors
      to be shut, and search made for a man with two black dots on his cheek.
      The chamberlain went among the guests, and soon found such a man, but just
      as he was going to arrest him and bring him before the king his eye fell
      on another with the same mark, and another, and another, till he had
      counted twenty&mdash;besides the Wise Man&mdash;on whose face were found
      spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not knowing what to do, the chamberlain hurried back with his tale to the
      king, who immediately sent for the Wise Man, and then for his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The thief must have stolen your bottle,&rsquo; said the king to the Wizard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, my lord, it is here,&rsquo; answered the Wise Man, holding it out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then he must have got yours,&rsquo; he cried, turning to his daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed, father, it is safe in my pocket,&rsquo; replied she, taking it out as
      she spoke; and they all three looked at each other and remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the king at last, &lsquo;the man who has done this is cleverer than
      most men, and if he will make himself known to me he shall marry the
      princess and govern half my kingdom while I am alive, and the whole of it
      when I am dead. Go and announce this in the ballroom,&rsquo; he added to an
      attendant, &lsquo;and bring the fellow hither.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So the attendant went into the ballroom and did as the king had bidden
      him, when, to his surprise, not one man, but twenty, stepped forward, all
      with black dots on their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am the person you want,&rsquo; they all exclaimed at once, and the attendant,
      as much bewildered as the chamberlain had been, desired them to follow him
      into the king&rsquo;s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the question was too difficult for the king to decide, so he called
      together his council. For hours they talked, but to no purpose, and in the
      end they hit upon a plan which they might just as well have thought of at
      the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      And this was the plan. A child was to be brought to the palace, and next
      the king&rsquo;s daughter would give her an apple. Then the child was to take
      the apple and be led into a room where the twenty men with the black dots
      were sitting in a ring. And to whomsoever the child gave the apple, that
      man should marry the king&rsquo;s daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said the king, &lsquo;it may not be the right man, after all, but
      then again it MAY be. Anyhow, it is the best we can do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The princess herself led the child into the room where the twenty men were
      now seated. She stood in the centre of the ring for a moment, looking at
      one man after another, and then held out the apple to the Shifty Lad, who
      was twisting a shaving of wood round his finger, and had the mouthpiece of
      a bagpipe hanging from his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ought not to have anything which the others have not got,&rsquo; said the
      chamberlain, who had accompanied the princess; and he bade the child stand
      outside for a minute, while he took away the shaving and the mouthpiece,
      and made the Shifty Lad change his place. Then he called the child in, but
      the little girl knew him again, and went straight up to him with the
      apple.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the man whom the child has twice chosen,&rsquo; said the chamberlain,
      signing to the Shifty Lad to kneel before the king. &lsquo;It was all quite
      fair; we tried it twice over.&rsquo; In this way the Shifty Lad won the king&rsquo;s
      daughter, and they were married the next day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later the bride and bridegroom were taking a walk together, and
      the path led down to the river, and over the river was a bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what bridge may this be?&rsquo; asked the Shifty Lad; and the princess told
      him that this was the bridge of Dublin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it indeed?&rsquo; cried he. &lsquo;Well, now, many is the time that my mother has
      said, when I played her a trick, that my end would be that I should hang
      on the bridge of Dublin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, if you want to fulfil her prophecies,&rsquo; laughed the princess, &lsquo;you
      have only to let me tie my handkerchief round your ankle, and I will hold
      you as you hang over the wall of the bridge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That would be fine fun,&rsquo; said he; &lsquo;but you are not strong enough to hold
      me up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, I am,&rsquo; said the princess; &lsquo;just try.&rsquo; So at last he let her bind
      the handkerchief round his ankle and hang him over the wall, and they both
      laughed and jested at the strength of the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now pull me up again,&rsquo; called he; but as he spoke a great cry arose that
      the palace was burning. The princess turned round with a start, and let go
      her handkerchief, and the Shifty Lad fell, and struck his head on a stone,
      and died in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      So his mother&rsquo;s prophecy had come true, after all.

    <h2>
      The False Prince and the True
    </h2>
    <p>
      The king had just awakened from his midday sleep, for it was summer, and
      everyone rose early and rested from twelve to three, as they do in hot
      countries. He had dressed himself in cool white clothes, and was passing
      through the hall on his way to the council chamber, when a number of young
      nobles suddenly appeared before him, and one amongst them stepped forward
      and spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sire, this morning we were all playing tennis in the court, the prince
      and this gentleman with the rest, when there broke out some dispute about
      the game. The prince lost his temper, and said many insulting things to
      the other, who was playing against him, till at length the gentleman whom
      you see there struck him violently in the face, so that the blood ran from
      his mouth and nose. We were all so horrified at the sight, that we should
      most likely have killed the man then and there, for daring to lay hands on
      the prince, had not his grandfather the duke stepped between and commanded
      us to lay the affair before you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The king had listened attentively to the story, and when it was ended he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose the prince had no arms with him, or else he would have used
      them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sire, he had arms; he always carries a dagger in his belt. But when
      he saw the blood pouring from his face, he went to a corner of the court
      and began to cry, which was the strangest thing of all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this the king walked to the window and stood for a few minutes
      with his back to the room, where the company of young men remained silent.
      Then he came back, his face white and stern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and it is the solemn truth, that I would rather
      you had told me that the prince was dead, though he is my only son, than
      know that he would suffer such an injury without attempting to avenge it.
      As for the gentleman who struck him, he will be brought before my judges,
      and will plead his own cause, but I hardly think he can escape death,
      after having assaulted the heir to the crown.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man raised his head as if to reply, but the king would not
      listen, and commanded his guards to put him under arrest, adding, however,
      that if the prisoner wished to visit any part of the city, he was at
      liberty to do so properly guarded, and in fifteen days he would be brought
      to trial before the highest judges in the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man left the king&rsquo;s presence, surrounded by soldiers, and
      accompanied by many of his friends, for he was a great favourite. By their
      advice he spent the fourteen days that remained to him going about to seek
      counsel from wise men of all sorts, as to how he might escape death, but
      no one could help him, for none could find any excuse for the blow he had
      given to the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fourteenth night had come, and in despair the prisoner went out to
      take his last walk through the city. He wandered on hardly knowing where
      he went, and his face was so white and desperate that none of his
      companions dared speak to him. The sad little procession had passed some
      hours in this manner, when, near the gate of a monastery, an old woman
      appeared round a corner, and suddenly stood before the young man. She was
      bent almost double, and was so wizened and wrinkled that she looked at
      least ninety; only her eyes were bright and quick as those of a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I know all that has happened to you, and how you are
      seeking if in any wise you can save your life. But there is none that can
      answer that question save only I myself, if you will promise to do all I
      ask.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At her words the prisoner felt as if a load had all at once been rolled
      off him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, save me, and I will do anything!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;It is so hard to leave
      the world and go out into the darkness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will not need to do that,&rsquo; answered the old woman, &lsquo;you have only got
      to marry me, and you will soon be free.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Marry you?&rsquo; exclaimed he, &lsquo;but&mdash;but&mdash;I am not yet twenty, and
      you &mdash;why, you must be a hundred at least! Oh, no, it is quite
      impossible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke without thinking, but the flash of anger which darted from her
      eyes made him feel uncomfortable. However, all she said was:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you like; since you reject me, let the crows have you,&rsquo; and hurried
      away down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left to himself, the full horror of his coming death rushed upon the young
      man, and he understood that he had thrown away his sole chance of life.
      Well, if he must, he must, he said to himself, and began to run as fast as
      he could after the old crone, who by this time could scarcely be seen,
      even in the moonlight. Who would have believed a woman past ninety could
      walk with such speed? It seemed more like flying! But at length,
      breathless and exhausted, he reached her side, and gasped out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Madam, pardon me for my hasty words just now; I was wrong, and will
      thankfully accept the offer you made me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I thought you would come to your senses,&rsquo; answered she, in rather an
      odd voice. &lsquo;We have no time to lose&mdash;follow me at once,&rsquo; and they
      went on silently and swiftly till they stopped at the door of a small
      house in which the priest lived. Before him the old woman bade the
      prisoner swear that she should be his wife, and this he did in the
      presence of witnesses. Then, begging the priest and the guards to leave
      them alone for a little, she told the young man what he was to do, when
      the next morning he was brought before the king and the judges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hall was full to overflowing when the prisoner entered it, and all
      marvelled at the brightness of his face. The king inquired if he had any
      excuse to plead for the high treason he had committed by striking the heir
      to the throne, and, if so, to be quick in setting it forth. With a low bow
      the youth made answer in a clear voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O my lord and gracious king, and you, nobles and wise men of the land, I
      leave my cause without fear in your hands, knowing that you will listen
      and judge rightly, and that you will suffer me to speak to the end, before
      you give judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For four years, you, O king, had been married to the queen and yet had no
      children, which grieved you greatly. The queen saw this, and likewise that
      your love was going from her, and thought night and day of some plan that
      might put an end to this evil. At length, when you were away fighting in
      distant countries, she decided what she would do, and adopted in secret
      the baby of a poor quarryman, sending a messenger to tell you that you had
      a son. No one suspected the truth except a priest to whom the queen
      confessed the truth, and in a few weeks she fell ill and died, leaving the
      baby to be brought up as became a prince. And now, if your highness will
      permit me, I will speak of myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What you have already told me,&rsquo; answered the king, &lsquo;is so strange that I
      cannot imagine what more there is to tell, but go on with your story.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One day, shortly after the death of the queen,&rsquo; continued the young man,
      &lsquo;your highness was hunting, and outstripped all your attendants while
      chasing the deer. You were in a part of the country which you did not
      know, so seeing an orchard all pink and white with apple-blossoms, and a
      girl tossing a ball in one corner, you went up to her to ask your way. But
      when she turned to answer you, you were so struck with her beauty that all
      else fled from your mind. Again and again you rode back to see her, and at
      length persuaded her to marry you. She only thought you a poor knight, and
      agreed that as you wished it, the marriage should be kept secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After the ceremony you gave her three rings and a charm with a cross on
      it, and then put her in a cottage in the forest, thinking to hide the
      matter securely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For some months you visited the cottage every week; but a rebellion broke
      out in a distant part of the kingdom, and called for your presence. When
      next you rode up to the cottage, it was empty, and none could inform you
      whither your bride had gone. That, sire, I can now tell you,&rsquo; and the
      young man paused and looked at the king, who coloured deeply. &lsquo;She went
      back to her father the old duke, once your chamberlain, and the cross on
      her breast revealed at once who you were. Fierce was his anger when he
      heard his daughter&rsquo;s tale, and he vowed that he would hide her safely from
      you, till the day when you would claim her publicly as your queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By and bye I was born, and was brought up by my grandfather in one of his
      great houses. Here are the rings you gave to my mother, and here is the
      cross, and these will prove if I am your son or not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke the young man laid the jewels at the feet of the king, and the
      nobles and the judges pressed round to examine them. The king alone did
      not move from his seat, for he had forgotten the hall of justice and all
      about him, and saw only the apple-orchard, as it was twenty years ago, and
      the beautiful girl playing at ball. A sudden silence round him made him
      look up, and he found the eyes of the assembly fixed on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is true; it is he who is my son, and not the other,&rsquo; he said with an
      effort, &lsquo;and let every man present swear to acknowledge him as king, after
      my death.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore one by one they all knelt before him and took the oath, and a
      message was sent to the false prince, forbidding him ever again to appear
      at court, though a handsome pension was granted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the ceremony was over, and the king, signing to his newly found
      son to follow him, rose and went into another room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me how you knew all that,&rsquo; he said, throwing himself into a carved
      chair filled with crimson cushions, and the prince told of his meeting
      with the old woman who had brought him the jewels from his mother, and how
      he had sworn before a priest to marry her, though he did not want to do
      it, on account of the difference in their ages, and besides, he would
      rather receive a bride chosen by the king himself. But the king frowned,
      and answered sharply:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You swore to marry her if she saved your life, and, come what may, you
      must fulfil your promise.&rsquo; Then, striking a silver shield that hung close
      by, he said to the equerry who appeared immediately:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go and seek the priest who lives near the door of the prison, and ask him
      where you can find the old woman who visited him last night; and when you
      have found her, bring her to the palace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It took some time to discover the whereabouts of the old woman, but at
      length it was accomplished, and when she arrived at the palace with the
      equerry, she was received with royal honours, as became the bride of the
      prince. The guards looked at each other with astonished eyes, as the
      wizened creature, bowed with age, passed between their lines; but they
      were more amazed still at the lightness of her step as she skipped up the
      steps to the great door before which the king was standing, with the
      prince at his side. If they both felt a shock at the appearance of the
      aged lady they did not show it, and the king, with a grave bow, took her
      band, and led her to the chapel, where a bishop was waiting to perform the
      marriage ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the next few weeks little was seen of the prince, who spent all his
      days in hunting, and trying to forget the old wife at home. As for the
      princess, no one troubled himself about her, and she passed the days alone
      in her apartments, for she had absolutely declined the services of the
      ladies-in-waiting whom the king had appointed for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night the prince returned after a longer chase than usual, and he was
      so tired that he went up straight to bed. Suddenly he was awakened by a
      strange noise in the room, and suspecting that a robber might have stolen
      in, he jumped out of bed, and seized his sword, which lay ready to his
      hand. Then he perceived that the noise proceeded from the next room, which
      belonged to the princess, and was lighted by a burning torch. Creeping
      softly to the door, he peeped through it, and beheld her lying quietly,
      with a crown of gold and pearls upon her head, her wrinkles all gone, and
      her face, which was whiter than the snow, as fresh as that of a girl of
      fourteen. Could that really be his wife&mdash;that beautiful, beautiful
      creature?
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince was still gazing in surprise when the lady opened her eyes and
      smiled at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I really am your wife,&rsquo; she said, as if she had guessed his
      thoughts, &lsquo;and the enchantment is ended. Now I must tell you who I am, and
      what befell to cause me to take the shape of an old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The king of Granada is my father, and I was born in the palace which
      overlooks the plain of the Vega. I was only a few months old when a wicked
      fairy, who had a spite against my parents, cast a spell over me, bending
      my back and wrinkling my skin till I looked as if I was a hundred years
      old, and making me such an object of disgust to everyone, that at length
      the king ordered my nurse to take my away from the palace. She was the
      only person who cared about me, and we lived together in this city on a
      small pension allowed me by the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I was about three an old man arrived at our house, and begged my
      nurse to let him come in and rest, as he could walk no longer. She saw
      that he was very ill, so put him to bed and took such care of him that by
      and bye he was as strong as ever. In gratitude for her goodness to him, he
      told her that he was a wizard and could give her anything she chose to ask
      for, except life or death, so she answered that what she longed for most
      in the world was that my wrinkled skin should disappear, and that I should
      regain the beauty with which I was born. To this he replied that as my
      misfortune resulted from a spell, this was rather difficult, but he would
      do his best, and at any rate he could promise that before my fifteenth
      birthday I should be freed from the enchantment if I could get a man who
      would swear to marry me as I was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you may suppose, this was not easy, as my ugliness was such that no
      one would look at me a second time. My nurse and I were almost in despair,
      as my fifteenth birthday was drawing near, and I had never so much as
      spoken to a man. At last we received a visit from the wizard, who told us
      what had happened at court, and your story, bidding me to put myself in
      your way when you had lost all hope, and offer to save you if you would
      consent to marry me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is my history, and now you must beg the king to send messengers at
      once to Granada, to inform my father of our marriage, and I think,&rsquo; she
      added with a smile, &lsquo;that he will not refuse us his blessing.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      The Jogi&rsquo;s Punishment
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once upon a time there came to the ancient city of Rahmatabad a jogi[FN#1:
      A Hindu holy man.] of holy appearance, who took up his abode under a tree
      outside the city, where he would sit for days at a time fasting from food
      and drink, motionless except for the fingers that turned restlessly his
      string of beads. The fame of such holiness as this soon spread, and daily
      the citizens would flock to see him, eager to get his blessing, to watch
      his devotions, or to hear his teaching, if he were in the mood to speak.
      Very soon the rajah himself heard of the jogi, and began regularly to
      visit him to seek his counsel and to ask his prayers that a son might be
      vouchsafed to him. Days passed by, and at last the rajah became so
      possessed with the thought of the holy man that he determined if possible
      to get him all to himself. So he built in the neighbourhood a little
      shrine, with a room or two added to it, and a small courtyard closely
      walled up; and, when all was ready, besought the jogi to occupy it, and to
      receive no other visitors except himself and his queen and such pupils as
      the jogi might choose, who would hand down his teaching. To this the jogi
      consented; and thus he lived for some time upon the king&rsquo;s bounty, whilst
      the fame of his godliness grew day by day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, although the rajah of Rahmatabad had no son, he possessed a daughter,
      who as she grew up became the most beautiful creature that eye ever rested
      upon. Her father had long before betrothed her to the son of the
      neighbouring rajah of Dilaram, but as yet she had not been married to him,
      and lived the quiet life proper to a maiden of her beauty and position.
      The princess had of course heard of the holy man and of his miracles and
      his fasting, and she was filled with curiosity to see and to speak to him;
      but this was difficult, since she was not allowed to go out except into
      the palace grounds, and then was always closely guarded. However, at
      length she found an opportunity, and made her way one evening alone to the
      hermit&rsquo;s shrine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unhappily, the hermit was not really as holy as he seemed; for no sooner
      did he see the princess than he fell in love with her wonderful beauty,
      and began to plot in his heart how he could win her for his wife. But the
      maiden was not only beautiful, she was also shrewd; and as soon as she
      read in the glance of the jogi the love that filled his soul, she sprang
      to her feet, and, gathering her veil about her, ran from the place as fast
      as she could. The jogi tried to follow, but he was no match for her; so,
      beside himself with rage at finding that he could not overtake her, he
      flung at her a lance, which wounded her in the leg. The brave princess
      stooped for a second to pluck the lance out of the wound, and then ran on
      until she found herself safe at home again. There she bathed and bound up
      the wound secretly, and told no one how naughty she had been, for she knew
      that her father would punish her severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, when the king went to visit the jogi, the holy man would neither
      speak to nor look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; asked the king. &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you speak to me to-day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have nothing to say that you would care to hear,&rsquo; answered the jogi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; said the king. &lsquo;Surely you know that I value all that you say,
      whatever it may be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But still the jogi sat with his face turned away, and the more the king
      pressed him the more silent and mysterious he became. At last, after much
      persuasion, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me tell you, then, that there is in this city a creature which, if
      you do not put an end to it, will kill every single person in the place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The king, who was easily frightened, grew pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; he gasped&mdash;&lsquo;what is this dreadful thing? How am I to know it
      and to catch it? Only counsel me and help me, and I will do all that you
      advise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; replied the jogi, &lsquo;it is indeed dreadful. It is in the shape of a
      beautiful girl, but it is really an evil spirit. Last evening it came to
      visit me, and when I looked upon it its beauty faded into hideousness, its
      teeth became horrible fangs, its eyes glared like coals of fire, great
      claws sprang from its slender fingers, and were I not what I am it might
      have consumed me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The king could hardly speak from alarm, but at last he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How am I to distinguish this awful thing when I see it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Search,&rsquo; said the jogi, &lsquo;for a lovely girl with a lance wound in her leg,
      and when she is found secure her safely and come and tell me, and I will
      advise you what to do next.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Away hurried the king, and soon set all his soldiers scouring the country
      for a girl with a lance wound in her left. For two days the search went
      on, and then it was somehow discovered that the only person with a lance
      wound in the leg was the princess herself. The king, greatly agitated,
      went off to tell the jogi, and to assure him that there must be some
      mistake. But of course the jogi was prepared for this, and had his answer
      ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is not really your daughter, who was stolen away at her birth, but an
      evil spirit that has taken her form,&rsquo; said he solemnly. &lsquo;You can do what
      you like, but if you don&rsquo;t take my advice she will kill you all.&rsquo; And so
      solemn he appeared, and so unshaken in his confidence, that the king&rsquo;s
      wisdom was blinded, and he declared that he would do whatever the jogi
      advised, and believe whatever he said. So the jogi directed him to send
      him secretly two carpenters; and when they arrived he set them to make a
      great chest, so cunningly jointed and put together that neither air nor
      water could penetrate it. There and then the chest was made, and, when it
      was ready, the jogi bade the king to bring the princess by night; and they
      two thrust the poor little maiden into the chest and fastened it down with
      long nails, and between them carried it to the river and pushed it out
      into the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the jogi got back from this deed he called two of his pupils,
      and pretended that it had been revealed to him that there should be found
      floating on the river a chest with something of great price within it; and
      he bade them go and watch for it at such a place far down the stream, and
      when the chest came slowly along, bobbing and turning in the tide, they
      were to seize it and secretly and swiftly bring it to him, for he was now
      determined to put the princess to death himself. The pupils set off at
      once, wondering at the strangeness of their errand, and still more at the
      holiness of the jogi to whom such secrets were revealed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that, as the next morning was dawning, the gallant young
      prince of Dilaram was hunting by the banks of the river, with a great
      following of wazirs, attendants, and huntsmen, and as he rode he saw
      floating on the river a large chest, which came slowly along, bobbing and
      turning in the tide. Raising himself in his saddle, he gave an order, and
      half a dozen men plunged into the water and drew the chest out on to the
      river bank, where every one crowded around to see what it could contain.
      The prince was certainly not the least curious among them; but he was a
      cautious young man, and, as he prepared to open the chest himself, he bade
      all but a few stand back, and these few to draw their swords, so as to be
      prepared in case the chest should hold some evil beast, or djinn, or
      giant. When all were ready and expectant, the prince with his dagger
      forced open the lid and flung it back, and there lay, living and
      breathing, the most lovely maiden he had ever seen in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although she was half stifled from her confinement in the chest, the
      princess speedily revived, and, when she was able to sit up, the prince
      began to question her as to who she was and how she came to be shut up in
      the chest and set afloat upon the water; and she, blushing and trembling
      to find herself in the presence of so many strangers, told him that she
      was the princess of Rahmatabad, and that she had been put into the chest
      by her own father. When he on his part told her that he was the prince of
      Dilaram, the astonishment of the young people was unbounded to find that
      they, who had been betrothed without ever having seen one another, should
      have actually met for the first time in such strange circumstances. In
      fact, the prince was so moved by her beauty and modest ways that he called
      up his wazirs and demanded to be married at once to this lovely lady who
      had so completely won his heart. And married they were then and there upon
      the river bank, and went home to the prince&rsquo;s palace, where, when the
      story was told, they were welcomed by the old rajah, the prince&rsquo;s father,
      and the remainder of the day was given over to feasting and rejoicing. But
      when the banquet was over, the bride told her husband that now, on the
      threshold of their married life, she had more to relate of her adventures
      than he had given her the opportunity to tell as yet; and then, without
      hiding anything, she informed him of all that happened to her from the
      time she had stolen out to visit the wicked jogi.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning the prince called his chief wazir and ordered him to shut
      up in the chest in which the princess had been found a great monkey that
      lived chained up in the palace, and to take the chest back to the river
      and set it afloat once more and watch what became of it. So the monkey was
      caught and put into the chest, and some of the prince&rsquo;s servants took it
      down to the river and pushed it off into the water. Then they followed
      secretly a long way off to see what became of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the jogi&rsquo;s two pupils watched and watched for the chest until
      they were nearly tired of watching, and were beginning to wonder whether
      the jogi was right after all, when on the second day they spied the great
      chest coming floating on the river, slowly bobbing and turning in the
      tide; and instantly a great joy and exultation seized them, for they
      thought that here indeed was further proof of the wonderful wisdom of
      their master. With some difficulty they secured the chest, and carried it
      back as swiftly and secretly as possible to the jogi&rsquo;s house. As soon as
      they brought in the chest, the jogi, who had been getting very cross and
      impatient, told them to put it down, and to go outside whilst he opened
      the magic chest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And even if you hear cries and sounds, however alarming, you must on no
      account enter,&rsquo; said the jogi, walking over to a closet where lay the
      silken cord that was to strangle the princess.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the two pupils did as they were told, and went outside and shut close
      all the doors. Presently they heard a great outcry within and the jogi&rsquo;s
      voice crying aloud for help; but they dared not enter, for had they not
      been told that whatever the noise, they must not come in? So they sat
      outside, waiting and wondering; and at last all grew still and quiet, and
      remained so for such a long time that they determined to enter and see if
      all was well. No sooner had they opened the door leading into the
      courtyard than they were nearly upset by a huge monkey that came leaping
      straight to the doorway and escaped past them into the open fields. Then
      they stepped into the room, and there they saw the jogi&rsquo;s body lying torn
      to pieces on the threshold of his dwelling!
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon the story spread, as stories will, and reached the ears of the
      princess and her husband, and when she knew that her enemy was dead she
      made her peace with her father.

    <h2>
      The Heart of a Monkey
    </h2>
    <p>
      A long time ago a little town made up of a collection of low huts stood in
      a tiny green valley at the foot of a cliff. Of course the people had taken
      great care to build their houses out of reach of the highest tide which
      might be driven on shore by a west wind, but on the very edge of the town
      there had sprung up a tree so large that half its boughs hung over the
      huts and the other half over the deep sea right under the cliff, where
      sharks loved to come and splash in the clear water. The branches of the
      tree itself were laden with fruit, and every day at sunrise a big grey
      monkey might have been seen sitting in the topmost branches having his
      breakfast, and chattering to himself with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      After he had eaten all the fruit on the town side of the tree the monkey
      swung himself along the branches to the part which hung over the water.
      While he was looking out for a nice shady place where he might perch
      comfortably he noticed a shark watching him from below with greedy eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can I do anything for you, my friend?&rsquo; asked the monkey politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! if you only would thrown me down some of those delicious things, I
      should be so grateful,&rsquo; answered the shark. &lsquo;After you have lived on fish
      for fifty years you begin to feel you would like a change. And I am so
      very, very tired of the taste of salt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t like salt myself,&rsquo; said the monkey; &lsquo;so if you will open
      your mouth I will throw this beautiful juicy kuyu into it,&rsquo; and, as he
      spoke, he pulled one off the branch just over his head. But it was not so
      easy to hit the shark&rsquo;s mouth as he supposed, even when the creature had
      turned on his back, and the first kuyu only struck one of his teeth and
      rolled into the water. However, the second time the monkey had better
      luck, and the fruit fell right in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, how good!&rsquo; cried the shark. &lsquo;Send me another, please.&rsquo; And the monkey
      grew tired of picking the kuyu long before the shark was tired of eating
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is getting late, and I must be going home to my children,&rsquo; he said, at
      length, &lsquo;but if you are here at the same time to-morrow I will give you
      another treat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, thank you,&rsquo; said the shark, showing all his great ugly teeth
      as he grinned with delight; &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t guess how happy you have made me,&rsquo; 
      and he swam away into the shadow, hoping to sleep away the time till the
      monkey came again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For weeks the monkey and the shark breakfasted together, and it was a
      wonder that the tree had any fruit left for them. They became fast
      friends, and told each other about their homes and their children, and how
      to teach them all they ought to know. By and bye the monkey became rather
      discontented with his green house in a grove of palms beyond the town, and
      longed to see the strange things under the sea which he had heard of from
      the shark. The shark perceived this very clearly, and described greater
      marvels, and the monkey as he listened grew more and more gloomy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters were in this state when one day the shark said: &lsquo;I really hardly
      know how to thank you for all your kindness to me during these weeks. Here
      I have nothing of my own to offer you, but if you would only consent to
      come home with me, how gladly would I give you anything that might happen
      to take your fancy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like nothing better,&rsquo; cried the monkey, his teeth chattering, as
      they always did when he was pleased. &lsquo;But how could I get there? Not by
      water. Ugh! It makes me ill to think of it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t let that trouble you,&rsquo; replied the shark, &lsquo;you have only to sit
      on my back and I will undertake that not a drop of water shall touch you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was arranged, and directly after breakfast next morning the shark
      swam close up under the tree and the monkey dropped neatly on his back,
      without even a splash. After a few minutes&mdash;for at first he felt a
      little frightened at his strange position&mdash;the monkey began to enjoy
      himself vastly, and asked the shark a thousand questions about the fish
      and the sea-weeds and the oddly-shaped things that floated past them, and
      as the shark always gave him some sort of answer, the monkey never guessed
      that many of the objects they saw were as new to his guide as to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun had risen and set six times when the shark suddenly said, &lsquo;My
      friend, we have now performed half our journey, and it is time that I
      should tell you something.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; asked the monkey. &lsquo;Nothing unpleasant, I hope, for you sound
      rather grave?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no! Nothing at all. It is only that shortly before we left I heard
      that the sultan of my country is very ill, and that the only thing to cure
      him is a monkey&rsquo;s heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor man, I am very sorry for him,&rsquo; replied the monkey; &lsquo;but you were
      unwise not to tell me till we had started.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; asked the shark; but the monkey, who now understood
      the whole plot, did not answer at once, for he was considering what he
      should say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why are you so silent?&rsquo; inquired the shark again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was thinking what a pity it was you did not tell me while I was still
      on land, and then I would have brought my heart with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your heart! Why isn&rsquo;t your heart here?&rsquo; said the shark, with a puzzled
      expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no! Of course not. Is it possible you don&rsquo;t know that when we leave
      home we always hang up our hearts on trees, to prevent their being
      troublesome? However, perhaps you won&rsquo;t believe that, and will just think
      I have invented it because I am afraid, so let us go on to your country as
      fast as we can, and when we arrive you can look for my heart, and if you
      find it you can kill me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The monkey spoke in such a calm, indifferent way that the shark was quite
      deceived, and began to wish he had not been in such a hurry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there is no use going on if your heart is not with you,&rsquo; he said at
      last. &lsquo;We had better turn back to the town, and then you can fetch it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, this was just what the monkey wanted, but he was careful not to
      seem too pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; he remarked carelessly, &lsquo;it is such a long way; but
      you may be right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure I am,&rsquo; answered the shark, &lsquo;and I will swim as quickly as I
      can,&rsquo; and so he did, and in three days they caught sight of the kuyu tree
      hanging over the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sigh of relief the monkey caught hold of the nearest branch and
      swung himself up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait for me here,&rsquo; he called out to the shark. &lsquo;I am so hungry I must
      have a little breakfast, and then I will go and look for my heart,&rsquo; and he
      went further and further into the branches so that the shark could not see
      him. Then he curled himself up and went to sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you there?&rsquo; cried the shark, who was soon tired of swimming about
      under the cliff, and was in haste to be gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The monkey awoke with a start, but did not answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you there?&rsquo; called the shark again, louder than before, and in a very
      cross voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes. I am here,&rsquo; replied the monkey; &lsquo;but I wish you had not wakened
      me up. I was having such a nice nap.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you got it?&rsquo; asked the shark. &lsquo;It is time we were going.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going where?&rsquo; inquired the monkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, to my country, of course, with your heart. You CAN&rsquo;T have
      forgotten!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear friend,&rsquo; answered the monkey, with a chuckle, &lsquo;I think you must
      be going a little mad. Do you take me for a washerman&rsquo;s donkey?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense,&rsquo; exclaimed the shark, who did not like being laughed
      at. &lsquo;What do you mean about a washerman&rsquo;s donkey? And I wish you would be
      quick, or we may be too late to save the sultan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you really never hear of the washerman&rsquo;s donkey?&rsquo; asked the monkey,
      who was enjoying himself immensely. &lsquo;Why, he is the beast who has no
      heart. And as I am not feeling very well, and am afraid to start while the
      sun is so high lest I should get a sunstroke, if you like, I will come a
      little nearer and tell you his story.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said the shark sulkily, &lsquo;if you won&rsquo;t come, I suppose I may
      as well listen to that as do nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So the monkey began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A washerman once lived in the great forest on the other side of the town,
      and he had a donkey to keep him company and to carry him wherever he
      wanted to go. For a time they got on very well, but by and bye the donkey
      grew lazy and ungrateful for her master&rsquo;s kindness, and ran away several
      miles into the heart of the forest, where she did nothing but eat and eat
      and eat, till she grew so fat she could hardly move.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One day as she was tasting quite a new kind of grass and wondering if it
      was as good as what she had had for dinner the day before, a hare happened
      to pass by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Well, that is a fat creature,&rdquo; thought she, and turned out of her path
      to tell the news to a lion who was a friend of hers. Now the lion had been
      very ill, and was not strong enough to go hunting for himself, and when
      the hare came and told him that a very fat donkey was to be found only a
      few hundred yards off, tears of disappointment and weakness filled his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What is the good of telling me that?&rdquo; he asked, in a weepy voice; &ldquo;you
      know I cannot even walk as far as that palm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Never mind,&rdquo; answered the hare briskly. &ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t go to your dinner
      your dinner shall come to you,&rdquo; and nodding a farewell to the lion she
      went back to the donkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said she, bowing politely to the donkey, who lifted her
      head in surprise. &ldquo;Excuse my interrupting you, but I have come on very
      important business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; answered the donkey, &ldquo;it is most kind of you to take the
      trouble. May I inquire what the business is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied the hare. &ldquo;It is my friend the lion who has heard so
      much of your charms and good qualities that he has sent me to beg that you
      will give him your paw in marriage. He regrets deeply that he is unable to
      make the request in person, but he has been ill and is too weak to move.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Poor fellow! How sad!&rdquo; said the donkey. &ldquo;But you must tell him that I
      feel honoured by his proposal, and will gladly consent to be Queen of the
      Beasts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Will you not come and tell him so yourself?&rdquo; asked the hare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Side by side they went down the road which led to the lion&rsquo;s house. It
      took a long while, for the donkey was so fat with eating she could only
      walk very slowly, and the hare, who could have run the distance in about
      five minutes, was obliged to creep along till she almost dropped with
      fatigue at not being able to go at her own pace. When at last they arrived
      the lion was sitting up at the entrance, looking very pale and thin. The
      donkey suddenly grew shy and hung her head, but the lion put on his best
      manners and invited both his visitors to come in and make themselves
      comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very soon the hare got up and said, &ldquo;Well, as I have another engagement I
      will leave you to make acquaintance with your future husband,&rdquo; and winking
      at the lion she bounded away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The donkey expected that as soon as they were left alone the lion would
      begin to speak of their marriage, and where they should live, but as he
      said nothing she looked up. To her surprise and terror she saw him
      crouching in the corner, his eyes glaring with a red light, and with a
      loud roar he sprang towards her. But in that moment the donkey had had
      time to prepare herself, and jumping on one side dealt the lion such a
      hard kick that he shrieked with the pain. Again and again he struck at her
      with his claws, but the donkey could bite too, as well as the lion, who
      was very weak after his illness, and at last a well-planted kick knocked
      him right over, and he rolled on the floor, groaning with pain. The donkey
      did not wait for him to get up, but ran away as fast as she could and was
      lost in the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now the hare, who knew quite well what would happen, had not gone to do
      her business, but hid herself in some bushes behind the cave, where she
      could hear quite clearly the sounds of the battle. When all was quiet
      again she crept gently out, and stole round the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Well, lion, have you killed her?&rdquo; asked she, running swiftly up the
      path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Killed her, indeed!&rdquo; answered the lion sulkily, &ldquo;it is she who has
      nearly killed me. I never knew a donkey could kick like that, though I
      took care she should carry away the marks of my claws.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Dear me! Fancy such a great fat creature being able to fight!&rdquo; cried the
      hare. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t vex yourself. Just lie still, and your wounds will soon
      heal,&rdquo; and she bade her friend, good bye, and returned to her family.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Two or three weeks passed, and only bare places on the donkey&rsquo;s back
      showed where the lion&rsquo;s claws had been, while, on his side, the lion had
      recovered from his illness and was now as strong as ever. He was beginning
      to think that it was almost time for him to begin hunting again, when one
      morning a rustle was heard in the creepers outside, and the hare&rsquo;s head
      peeped through.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Ah! there is no need to ask how you are,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Still you mustn&rsquo;t
      overtire yourself, you know. Shall I go and bring you your dinner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;If you will bring me that donkey I will tear it in two,&rdquo; cried the lion
      savagely, and the hare laughed and nodded and went on her errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This time the donkey was much further than before, and it took longer to
      find her. At last the hare caught sight of four hoofs in the air, and ran
      towards them. The donkey was lying on a soft cool bed of moss near a
      stream, rolling herself backwards and forwards from pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; said the hare politely, and the donkey got slowly on to
      her legs, and looked to see who her visitor could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, it is you, is it?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;Come and have a chat. What news
      have you got?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t stay,&rdquo; answered the hare; &ldquo;but I promised the lion to beg you
      to pay him a visit, as he is not well enough to call on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the donkey gloomily, &ldquo;the last time we went
      he scratched me very badly, and really I was quite afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;He was only trying to kiss you,&rdquo; said the hare, &ldquo;and you bit him, and of
      course that made him cross.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;If I were sure of that,&rdquo; hesitated the donkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, you may be quite sure,&rdquo; laughed the hare. &ldquo;I have a large
      acquaintance among lions. But let us be quick,&rdquo; and rather unwillingly the
      donkey set out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The lion saw them coming and hid himself behind a large tree. As the
      donkey went past, followed by the hare, he sprang out, and with one blow
      of his paw stretched the poor foolish creature dead before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Take this meat and skin it and roast it,&rdquo; he said to the hare; &ldquo;but my
      appetite is not so good as it was, and the only part I want for myself is
      the heart. The rest you can either eat yourself or give away to your
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied the hare, balancing the donkey on her back as well
      as she was able, and though the legs trailed along the ground she managed
      to drag it to an open space some distance off, where she made a fire and
      roasted it. As soon as it was cooked the hare took out the heart and had
      just finished eating it when the lion, who was tired of waiting, came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I am hungry,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Bring me the creature&rsquo;s heart; it is just what I
      want for supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;But there is no heart,&rdquo; answered the hare, looking up at the lion with a
      puzzled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;What nonsense!&rdquo; said the lion. &ldquo;As if every beast had not got a heart.
      What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;This is a washerman&rsquo;s donkey,&rdquo; replied the hare gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Well, and suppose it is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Oh, fie!&rdquo; exclaimed the hare. &ldquo;You, a lion and a grown-up person, and
      ask questions like that. If the donkey had had a heart would she be here
      now? The first time she came she knew you were trying to kill her, and ran
      away. Yet she came back a second time. Well, if she had had a heart would
      she have come back a second time? Now would she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the lion answered slowly, &ldquo;No, she would not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you think I am a washerman&rsquo;s donkey?&rsquo; said the monkey to the shark,
      when the story was ended. &lsquo;You are wrong; I am not. And as the sun is
      getting low in the sky, it is time for you to begin your homeward journey.
      You will have a nice cool voyage, and I hope you will find the sultan
      better. Farewell!&rsquo; And the monkey disappeared among the green branches,
      and was gone.

    <h2>
      The Fairy Nurse
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was once a little farmer and his wife living near Coolgarrow. They
      had three children, and my story happened while the youngest was a baby.
      The wife was a good wife enough, but her mind was all on her family and
      her farm, and she hardly ever went to her knees without falling asleep,
      and she thought the time spent in the chapel was twice as long as it need
      be. So, friends, she let her man and her two children go before her one
      day to Mass, while she called to consult a fairy man about a disorder one
      of her cows had. She was late at the chapel, and was sorry all the day
      after, for her husband was in grief about it, and she was very fond of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late that night he was wakened up by the cries of his children calling out
      &lsquo;Mother! Mother!&rsquo; When he sat up and rubbed his eyes, there was no wife by
      his side, and when he asked the little ones what was become of their
      mother, they said they saw the room full of nice little men and women,
      dressed in white and red and green, and their mother in the middle of
      them, going out by the door as if she was walking in her sleep. Out he
      ran, and searched everywhere round the house but, neither tale nor tidings
      did he get of her for many a day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the poor man was miserable enough, for he was as fond of his woman
      as she was of him. It used to bring the salt tears down his cheeks to see
      his poor children neglected and dirty, as they often were, and they&rsquo;d be
      bad enough only for a kind neighbour that used to look in whenever she
      could spare time. The infant was away with a nurse.
    </p>
    <p>
      About six weeks after&mdash;just as he was going out to his work one
      morning&mdash;a neighbour, that used to mind women when they were ill,
      came up to him, and kept step by step with him to the field, and this is
      what she told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just as I was falling asleep last night, I heard a horse&rsquo;s tramp on the
      grass and a knock at the door, and there, when I came out, was a
      fine-looking dark man, mounted on a black horse, and he told me to get
      ready in all haste, for a lady was in great want of me. As soon as I put
      on my cloak and things, he took me by the hand, and I was sitting behind
      him before I felt myself stirring. &ldquo;Where are we going, sir?&rdquo; says I.
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll soon know,&rdquo; says he; and he drew his fingers across my eyes, and
      not a ray could I see. I kept a tight grip of him, and I little knew
      whether he was going backwards or forwards, or how long we were about it,
      till my hand was taken again, and I felt the ground under me. The fingers
      went the other way across my eyes, and there we were before a castle door,
      and in we went through a big hall and great rooms all painted in fine
      green colours, with red and gold bands and ornaments, and the finest
      carpets and chairs and tables and window curtains, and grand ladies and
      gentlemen walking about. At last we came to a bedroom, with a beautiful
      lady in bed, with a fine bouncing boy beside her. The lady clapped her
      hands, and in came the Dark Man and kissed her and the baby, and praised
      me, and gave me a bottle of green ointment to rub the child all over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, the child I rubbed, sure enough; but my right eye began to smart,
      and I put up my finger and gave it a rub, and then stared, for never in
      all my life was I so frightened. The beautiful room was a big, rough cave,
      with water oozing over the edges of the stones and through the clay; and
      the lady, and the lord, and the child weazened, poverty-bitten creatures&mdash;nothing
      but skin and bone&mdash;and the rich dresses were old rags. I didn&rsquo;t let
      on that I found any difference, and after a bit says the Dark Man, &ldquo;Go
      before me to the hall door, and I will be with you in a few moments, and
      see you safe home.&rdquo; Well, just as I turned into the outside cave, who
      should I see watching near the door but poor Molly. She looked round all
      terrified, and says she to me in a whisper, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m brought here to nurse the
      child of the king and queen of the fairies; but there is one chance of
      saving me. All the court will pass the cross near Templeshambo next Friday
      night, on a visit to the fairies of Old Ross. If John can catch me by the
      hand or cloak when I ride by, and has courage not to let go his grip, I&rsquo;ll
      be safe. Here&rsquo;s the king. Don&rsquo;t open your mouth to answer. I saw what
      happened with the ointment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Dark Man didn&rsquo;t once cast his eye towards Molly, and he seemed to
      have no suspicion of me. When we came out I looked about me, and where do
      you think we were but in the dyke of the Rath of Cromogue. I was on the
      horse again, which was nothing but a big rag-weed, and I was in dread
      every minute I&rsquo;d fall off; but nothing happened till I found myself in my
      own cabin. The king slipped five guineas into my hand as soon as I was on
      the ground, and thanked me, and bade me good night. I hope I&rsquo;ll never see
      his face again. I got into bed, and couldn&rsquo;t sleep for a long time; and
      when I examined my five guineas this morning, that I left in the table
      drawer the last thing, I found five withered leaves of oak&mdash;bad luck
      to the giver!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, you may all think the fright, and the joy, and the grief the poor
      man was in when the woman finished her story. They talked and they talked,
      but we needn&rsquo;t mind what they said till Friday night came, when both were
      standing where the mountain road crosses the one going to Ross.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they stood, looking towards the bridge of Thuar, in the dead of the
      night, with a little moonlight shining from over Kilachdiarmid. At last
      she gave a start, and &ldquo;By this and by that,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;here they come,
      bridles jingling and feathers tossing!&rdquo; He looked, but could see nothing;
      and she stood trembling and her eyes wide open, looking down the way to
      the ford of Ballinacoola. &ldquo;I see your wife,&rdquo; says she, &ldquo;riding on the
      outside just so as to rub against us. We&rsquo;ll walk on quietly, as if we
      suspected nothing, and when we are passing I&rsquo;ll give you a shove. If you
      don&rsquo;t do YOUR duty then, woe be with you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Well, they walked on easy, and the poor hearts beating in both their
      breasts; and though he could see nothing, he heard a faint jingle and
      trampling and rustling, and at last he got the push that she promised. He
      spread out his arms, and there was his wife&rsquo;s waist within them, and he
      could see her plain; but such a hullabulloo rose as if there was an
      earthquake, and he found himself surrounded by horrible-looking things,
      roaring at him and striving to pull his wife away. But he made the sign of
      the cross and bid them begone in God&rsquo;s name, and held his wife as if it
      was iron his arms were made of. Bedad, in one moment everything was as
      silent as the grave, and the poor woman lying in a faint in the arms of
      her husband and her good neighbour. Well, all in good time she was minding
      her family and her business again; and I&rsquo;ll go bail, after the fright she
      got, she spent more time on her knees, and avoided fairy men all the days
      of the week, and particularly on Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hard to have anything to do with the good people without getting a
      mark from them. My brave nurse didn&rsquo;t escape no more than another. She was
      one Thursday at the market of Enniscorthy, when what did she see walking
      among the tubs of butter but the Dark Man, very hungry-looking, and taking
      a scoop out of one tub and out of another. &lsquo;Oh, sir,&rsquo; says she, very
      foolish, &lsquo;I hope your lady is well, and the baby.&rsquo; &lsquo;Pretty well, thank
      you,&rsquo; says he, rather frightened like. &lsquo;How do I look in this new suit?&rsquo; 
      says he, getting to one side of her. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t see you plain at all, sir,&rsquo; 
      says she. &lsquo;Well, now?&rsquo; says he, getting round her back to the other side.
      &lsquo;Musha, indeed, sir, your coat looks no better than a withered dock-leaf.&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Maybe, then,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;it will be different now,&rsquo; and he struck the eye
      next him with a switch. Friends, she never saw a glimmer after with that
      one till the day of her death.

    <h2>
      A Lost Paradise
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the middle of a great forest there lived a long time ago a
      charcoal-burner and his wife. They were both young and handsome and
      strong, and when they got married, they thought work would never fail
      them. But bad times came, and they grew poorer and poorer, and the nights
      in which they went hungry to bed became more and more frequent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now one evening the king of that country was hunting near the
      charcoal-burner&rsquo;s hut. As he passed the door, he heard a sound of sobbing,
      and being a good-natured man he stopped to listen, thinking that perhaps
      he might be able to give some help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Were there ever two people so unhappy!&rsquo; said a woman&rsquo;s voice. &lsquo;Here we
      are, ready to work like slaves the whole day long, and no work can we get.
      And it is all because of the curiosity of old mother Eve! If she had only
      been like me, who never want to know anything, we should all have been as
      happy as kings to-day, with plenty to eat, and warm clothes to wear. Why&mdash;&rsquo; 
      but at this point a loud knock interrupted her lamentations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is there?&rsquo; asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I!&rsquo; replied somebody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And who is &ldquo;I&rdquo;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The king. Let me in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of surprise the woman jumped up and pulled the bar away from the
      door. As the king entered, he noticed that there was no furniture in the
      room at all, not even a chair, so he pretended to be in too great a hurry
      to see anything around him, and only said &lsquo;You must not let me disturb
      you. I have no time to stay, but you seemed to be in trouble. Tell me; are
      you very unhappy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, my lord, we can find no work and have eaten nothing for two days!&rsquo; 
      answered she. &lsquo;Nothing remains for us but to die of hunger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, you shan&rsquo;t do that,&rsquo; cried the king, &lsquo;or if you do, it will be
      your own fault. You shall come with me into my palace, and you will feel
      as if you were in Paradise, I promise you. In return, I only ask one thing
      of you, that you shall obey my orders exactly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The charcoal-burner and his wife both stared at him for a moment, as if
      they could hardly believe their ears; and, indeed, it was not to be
      wondered at! Then they found their tongues, and exclaimed together:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, yes, my lord! we will do everything you tell us. How could we be
      so ungrateful as to disobey you, when you are so kind?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The king smiled, and his eyes twinkled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, let us start at once,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;Lock your door, and put the key in
      your pocket.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman looked as if she thought this was needless, seeing it was quite,
      quite certain they would never come back. But she dared not say so, and
      did as the king told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After walking through the forest for a couple of miles, they all three
      reached the palace, and by the king&rsquo;s orders servants led the
      charcoal-burner and his wife into rooms filled with beautiful things such
      as they had never even dreamed of. First they bathed in green marble baths
      where the water looked like the sea, and then they put on silken clothes
      that felt soft and pleasant. When they were ready, one of the king&rsquo;s
      special servants entered, and took them into a small hall, where dinner
      was laid, and this pleased them better than anything else.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were just about to sit down to the table when the king walked in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you have been attended to properly,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and that you will
      enjoy your dinner. My steward will take care you have all you want, and I
      wish you to do exactly as you please. Oh, by the bye, there is one thing!
      You notice that soup-tureen in the middle of the table? Well, be careful
      on no account to lift the lid. If once you take off the cover, there is an
      end of your good fortune.&rsquo; Then, bowing to his guests, he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you hear what he said?&rsquo; inquired the charcoal-burner in an
      awe-stricken voice. &lsquo;We are to have what we want, and do what we please.
      Only we must not touch the soup-tureen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, of course we won&rsquo;t,&rsquo; answered the wife. &lsquo;Why should we wish to? But
      all the same it is rather odd, and one can&rsquo;t help wondering what is
      inside.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For many days life went on like a beautiful dream to the charcoal-burner
      and his wife. Their beds were so comfortable, they could hardly make up
      their minds to get up, their clothes were so lovely they could scarcely
      bring themselves to take them off; their dinners were so good that they
      found it very difficult to leave off eating. Then outside the palace were
      gardens filled with rare flowers and fruits and singing birds, or if they
      desired to go further, a golden coach, painted with wreaths of
      forget-me-nots and lined with blue satin, awaited their orders. Sometimes
      it happened that the king came to see them, and he smiled as he glanced at
      the man, who was getting rosier and plumper each day. But when his eyes
      rested on the woman, they took on a look which seemed to say &lsquo;I knew it,&rsquo; 
      though this neither the charcoal-burner nor his wife ever noticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why are you so silent?&rsquo; asked the man one morning when dinner had passed
      before his wife had uttered one word. &lsquo;A little while ago you used to be
      chattering all the day long, and now I have almost forgotten the sound of
      your voice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, nothing; I did not feel inclined to talk, that was all!&rsquo; She stopped,
      and added carelessly after a pause, &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever wonder what is in that
      soup-tureen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, never,&rsquo; replied the man. &lsquo;It is no affair of ours,&rsquo; and the
      conversation dropped once more, but as time went on, the woman spoke less
      and less, and seemed so wretched that her husband grew quite frightened
      about her. As to her food, she refused one thing after another.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear wife,&rsquo; said the man at last, &lsquo;you really must eat something. What
      in the world is the matter with you? If you go on like this you will die.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would rather die than not know what is in that tureen,&rsquo; she burst forth
      so violently that the husband was quite startled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that it?&rsquo; cried he; &lsquo;are you making yourself miserable because of
      that? Why, you know we should be turned out of the palace, and sent away
      to starve.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no, we shouldn&rsquo;t. The king is too good-natured. Of course he didn&rsquo;t
      mean a little thing like this! Besides, there is no need to lift the lid
      off altogether. Just raise one corner so that I may peep. We are quite
      alone: nobody will ever know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man hesitated: it did seem a &lsquo;little thing,&rsquo; and if it was to make his
      wife contented and happy it was well worth the risk. So he took hold of
      the handle of the cover and raised it very slowly and carefully, while the
      woman stooped down to peep. Suddenly she startled back with a scream, for
      a small mouse had sprung from the inside of the tureen, and had nearly hit
      her in the eye. Round and round the room it ran, round and round they both
      ran after it, knocking down chairs and vases in their efforts to catch the
      mouse and put it back in the tureen. In the middle of all the noise the
      door opened, and the mouse ran out between the feet of the king. In one
      instant both the man and his wife were hiding under the table, and to all
      appearance the room was empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may as well come out,&rsquo; said the king, &lsquo;and hear what I have to say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know what it is,&rsquo; answered the charcoal-burner, hanging his head. The
      mouse has escaped.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A guard of soldiers will take you back to your hut,&rsquo; said the king. &lsquo;Your
      wife has the key.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Weren&rsquo;t they silly?&rsquo; cried the grandchildren of the charcoal-burners when
      they heard the story. &lsquo;How we wish that we had had the chance! WE should
      never have wanted to know what was in the soup-tureen!&rsquo;

    <h2>
      How Brave Walter Hunted Wolves
    </h2>
    <p>
      A little back from the high road there stands a house which is called
      &lsquo;Hemgard.&rsquo; Perhaps you remember the two beautiful mountain ash trees by
      the reddish-brown palings, and the high gate, and the garden with the
      beautiful barberry bushes which are always the first to become grown in
      spring, and which in summer are weighed down with their beautiful berries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind the garden there is a hedge with tall aspens which rustle in the
      morning wind, behind the hedge is a road, behind the road is a wood, and
      behind the wood the wide world.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the other side of the garden there is a lake, and beyond the lake
      is a village, and all around stretch meadows and fields, now yellow, now
      green.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the pretty house, which has white window-frames, a neat porch and clean
      steps, which are always strewn with finely-cut juniper leaves, Walter&rsquo;s
      parents live. His brother Frederick, his sister Lotta, old Lena, Jonah,
      Caro and Bravo, Putte and Murre, and Kuckeliku.
    </p>
    <p>
      Caro lives in the dog house, Bravo in the stable, Putte with the
      stableman, Murre a little here and a little there, and Kuckeliku lives in
      the hen house, that is his kingdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter is six years old, and he must soon begin to go to school. He cannot
      read yet, but he can do many other things. He can turn cartwheels, stand
      on his head, ride see-saw, throw snowballs, play ball, crow like a cock,
      eat bread and butter and drink sour milk, tear his trousers, wear holes in
      his elbows, break the crockery in pieces, throw balls through the
      windowpanes, draw old men on important papers, walk over the flower-beds,
      eat himself sick with gooseberries, and be well after a whipping. For the
      rest he has a good heart but a bad memory, and forgets his father&rsquo;s and
      his mother&rsquo;s admonitions, and so often gets into trouble and meets with
      adventures, as you shall hear, but first of all I must tell you how brave
      he was and how he hunted wolves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once in the spring, a little before Midsummer, Walter heard that there
      were a great many wolves in the wood, and that pleased him. He was
      wonderfully brave when he was in the midst of his companions or at home
      with his brothers and sister, then he used often to say &lsquo;One wolf is
      nothing, there ought to be at least four.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When he wrestled with Klas Bogenstrom or Frithiof Waderfelt and struck
      them in the back, he would say &lsquo;That is what I shall do to a wolf!&rsquo; and
      when he shot arrows at Jonas and they rattled against his sheepskin coat
      he would say: &lsquo;That is how I should shoot you if you were a wolf!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, some thought that the brave boy boasted a little; but one must
      indeed believe him since he said so himself. So Jonas and Lena used to say
      of him &lsquo;Look, there goes Walter, who shoots the wolves.&rsquo; And other boys
      and girls would say &lsquo;Look, there goes brave Walter, who is brave enough to
      fight with four.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no one so fully convinced of this as Walter himself, and one day
      he prepared himself for a real wolf hunt. He took with him his drum, which
      had holes in one end since the time he had climbed up on it to reach a
      cluster of rowan berries, and his tin sabre, which was a little broken,
      because he had with incredible courage fought his way through a whole
      unfriendly army of gooseberry bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not forget to arm himself quite to the teeth with his pop-gun, his
      bow, and his air-pistol. He had a burnt cork in his pocket to blacken his
      moustache, and a red cock&rsquo;s feather to put in his cap to make himself look
      fierce. He had besides in his trouser pocket a clasp knife with a bone
      handle, to cut off the ears of the wolves as soon as he had killed them,
      for he thought it would be cruel to do that while they were still living.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such a good thing that Jonas was going with corn to the mill, for
      Walter got a seat on the load, while Caro ran barking beside them. As soon
      as they came to the wood Walter looked cautiously around him to see
      perchance there was a wolf in the bushes, and he did not omit to ask Jonas
      if wolves were afraid of a drum. &lsquo;Of course they are&rsquo; (that is understood)
      said Jonas. Thereupon Walter began to beat his drum with all his might
      while they were going through the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they came to the mill Walter immediately asked if there had been any
      wolves in the neighbourhood lately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alas! yes,&rsquo; said the miller, &lsquo;last night the wolves have eaten our
      fattest ram there by the kiln not far from here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Walter, &lsquo;do you think that there were many?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; answered the miller.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it is all the same,&rsquo; said Walter. &lsquo;I only asked so that I should know
      if I should take Jonas with me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could manage very well alone with three, but if there were more, I
      might not have time to kill them all before they ran away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In Walter&rsquo;s place I should go quite alone, it is more manly,&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it is better for you to come too,&rsquo; said Walter. &lsquo;Perhaps there are
      many.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I have not time,&rsquo; said Jonas, &lsquo;and besides, there are sure not to be
      more than three. Walter can manage them very well alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Walter, &lsquo;certainly I could; but, you see, Jonas, it might
      happen that one of them might bite me in the back, and I should have more
      trouble in killing them. If I only knew that there were not more than two
      I should not mind, for them I should take one in each hand and give them a
      good shaking, like Susanna once shook me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I certainly think that there will not be more than two,&rsquo; said Jonas,
      &lsquo;there are never more than two when they slay children and rams; Walter
      can very well shake them without me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, you see, Jonas,&rsquo; said Walter, &lsquo;if there are two, it might still
      happen that one of them escapes and bites me in the leg, for you see I am
      not so strong in the left hand as in the right. You can very well come
      with me, and take a good stick in case there are really two. Look, if
      there is only one, I shall take him so with both my hands and thrown him
      living on to his back, and he can kick as much as he likes, I shall hold
      him fast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, when I really think over the thing,&rsquo; said Jonas, &lsquo;I am almost sure
      there will not be more than one. What would two do with one ram? There
      will certainly not be more than one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you should come with me all the same, Jonas,&rsquo; said Walter. &lsquo;You see I
      can very well manage one, but I am not quite accustomed to wolves yet, and
      he might tear holes in my new trousers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, just listen,&rsquo; said Jonas, &lsquo;I am beginning to think that Walter is
      not so brave as people say. First of all Walter would fight against four,
      and then against three, then two, and then one, and now Walter wants help
      with one. Such a thing must never be; what would people say? Perhaps they
      would think that Walter is a coward?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a lie,&rsquo; said Walter, &lsquo;I am not at all frightened, but it is more
      amusing when there are two. I only want someone who will see how I strike
      the wolf and how the dust flies out of his skin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, Walter can take the miller&rsquo;s little Lisa with him. She can
      sit on a stone and look on,&rsquo; said Jonas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, she would certainly be frightened,&rsquo; said Walter, &lsquo;and how would it do
      for a girl to go wolf-hunting? Come with me, Jonas, and you shall have the
      skin, and I will be content with the ears and the tail.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; said Jonas, &lsquo;Walter can keep the skin for himself. Now I
      see quite well that he is frightened. Fie, shame on him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This touched Walter&rsquo;s pride very near. &lsquo;I shall show that I am not
      frightened,&rsquo; he said; and so he took his drum, sabre, cock&rsquo;s feather,
      clasp-knife, pop-gun and air-pistol, and went off quite alone to the wood
      to hunt wolves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautiful evening, and the birds were singing in all the
      branches. Walter went very slowly and cautiously. At every step he looked
      all round him to see if perchance there was anything lurking behind the
      stones. He quite thought something moved away there in the ditch. Perhaps
      it was a wolf. &lsquo;It is better for me to beat the drum a little before I go
      there,&rsquo; thought Walter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Br-r-r, so he began to beat his drum. Then something moved again. Caw!
      caw! a crow flew up from the ditch. Walter immediately regained courage.
      &lsquo;It was well I took my drum with me,&rsquo; he thought, and went straight on
      with courageous steps. Very soon he came quite close to the kiln, where
      the wolves had killed the ram. But the nearer he came the more dreadful he
      thought the kiln looked. It was so gray and old. Who knew how many wolves
      there might be hidden there? Perhaps the very ones which killed the ram
      were still sitting there in a corner. Yes, it was not at all safe here,
      and there were no other people to be seen in the neighbourhood. It would
      be horrible to be eaten up here in the daylight, thought Walter to
      himself; and the more he thought about it the uglier and grayer the old
      kiln looked, and the more horrible and dreadful it seemed to become the
      food of wolves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I go back and say that I struck one wolf and it escaped?&rsquo; thought
      Walter. &lsquo;Fie!&rsquo; said his conscience, &lsquo;Do you not remember that a lie is one
      of the worst sins, both in the sight of God and man? If you tell a lie
      to-day and say you struck a wolf, to-morrow surely it will eat you up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I will go to the kiln,&rsquo; thought Walter, and so he went. But he did
      not go quite near. He went only so near that he could see the ram&rsquo;s blood
      which coloured the grass red, and some tufts of wool which the wolves had
      torn from the back of the poor animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It looked so dreadful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder what the ram thought when they ate him up,&rsquo; thought Walter to
      himself; and just then a cold shiver ran through him from his collar right
      down to his boots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is better for me to beat the drum,&rsquo; he thought to himself again, and
      so he began to beat it. But it sounded horrid, and an echo came out from
      the kiln that seemed almost like the howl of a wolf. The drumsticks
      stiffened in Walter&rsquo;s hands, and he thought now they are coming...!
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, sure enough, just then a shaggy, reddish-brown wolf&rsquo;s head looked out
      from under the kiln!
    </p>
    <p>
      What did Walter do now? Yes, the brave Walter who alone could manage four,
      threw his drum far away, took to his heels and ran, and ran as fast as he
      could back to the mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, alas! the wolf ran after him. Walter looked back; the wolf was
      quicker than he and only a few steps behind him. Then Walter ran faster.
      But fear got the better of him, he neither heard nor saw anything more. He
      ran over sticks, stones and ditches; he lost drum-sticks, sabre, bow, and
      air-pistol, and in his terrible hurry he tripped over a tuft of grass.
      There he lay, and the wolf jumped on to him....
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a gruesome tale! Now you may well believe that it was all over with
      Walter and all his adventures. That would have been a pity. But do not be
      surprised if it was not quite so bad as that, for the wolf was quite a
      friendly one. He certainly jumped on to Walter, but he only shook his coat
      and rubbed his nose against his face; and Walter shrieked. Yes, he
      shrieked terribly!
    </p>
    <p>
      Happily Jonas heard his cry of distress, for Walter was quite near the
      mill now, and he ran and helped him up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has happened?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;Why did Walter scream so terribly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A wolf! A wolf!&rsquo; cried Walter, and that was all he could say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is the wolf?&rsquo; said Jonas. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t see any wolf.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care, he is here, he has bitten me to death,&rsquo; groaned Walter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Jonas began to laugh; yes, he laughed so that he nearly burst his
      skin belt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, well, was that the wolf? Was that the wolf which Walter was to take
      by the neck and shake and throw down on its back, no matter how much it
      struggled? Just look a little closer at him: he is your old friend, your
      own good old Caro. I quite expect he found a leg of the ram in the kiln.
      When Walter beat his drum, Caro crept out, and when Walter ran away, Caro
      ran after him, as he so often does when Walter wants to romp and play.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Down, Caro! you ought to be rather ashamed to have put such a great hero
      to flight!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Walter got up feeling very foolish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Down, Caro!&rsquo; he said, both relieved and annoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was only a dog, then if it had been a wolf I certainly should have
      killed him....&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If Walter would listen to my advice, and boast a little less, and do a
      little more,&rsquo; said Jonas, consolingly. &lsquo;Walter is not a coward, is he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I! You shall see, Jonas, when we next meet a bear. You see I like so much
      better to fight with bears.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; laughed Jonas. &lsquo;Are you at it again?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear Walter, remember that it is only cowards who boast; a really brave
      man never talks of his bravery.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      The King of the Waterfalls
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the young king of Easaidh Ruadh came into his kingdom, the first
      thing he thought of was how he could amuse himself best. The sports that
      all his life had pleased him best suddenly seemed to have grown dull, and
      he wanted to do something he had never done before. At last his face
      brightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I will go and play a game with the Gruagach.&rsquo; Now the
      Gruagach was a kind of wicked fairy, with long curly brown hair, and his
      house was not very far from the king&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though the king was young and eager, he was also prudent, and his
      father had told him on his deathbed to be very careful in his dealings
      with the &lsquo;good people,&rsquo; as the fairies were called. Therefore before going
      to the Gruagach the king sought out a wise man of the countryside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am wanting to play a game with the curly-haired Gruagach,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you, indeed?&rsquo; replied the wizard. &lsquo;If you will take my counsel, you
      will play with someone else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; I will play with the Gruagach,&rsquo; persisted the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, if you must, you must, I suppose,&rsquo; answered the wizard; &lsquo;but if you
      win that game, ask as a prize the ugly crop-headed girl that stands behind
      the door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      So before the sun rose he got up and went to the house of the Gruagach,
      who was sitting outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O king, what has brought you here to-day?&rsquo; asked the Gruagach. &lsquo;But right
      welcome you are, and more welcome will you be still if you will play a
      game with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is just what I want,&rsquo; said the king, and they played; and sometimes
      it seemed as if one would win, and sometimes the other, but in the end it
      was the king who was the winner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what is the prize that you will choose?&rsquo; inquired the Gruagach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The ugly crop-headed girl that stands behind the door,&rsquo; replied the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, there are twenty others in the house, and each fairer than she!&rsquo; 
      exclaimed the Gruagach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fairer they may be, but it is she whom I wish for my wife, and none
      other,&rsquo; and the Gruagach saw that the king&rsquo;s mind was set upon her, so he
      entered his house, and bade all the maidens in it come out one by one, and
      pass before the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      One by one they came; tall and short, dark and fair, plump and thin, and
      each said &lsquo;I am she whom you want. You will be foolish indeed if you do
      not take me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But he took none of them, neither short nor tall, dark nor fair, plump nor
      thin, till at the last the crop-headed girl came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is mine,&rsquo; said the king, though she was so ugly that most men would
      have turned from her. &lsquo;We will be married at once, and I will carry you
      home.&rsquo; And married they were, and they set forth across a meadow to the
      king&rsquo;s house. As they went, the bride stooped and picked a sprig of
      shamrock, which grew amongst the grass, and when she stood upright again
      her ugliness had all gone, and the most beautiful woman that ever was seen
      stood by the king&rsquo;s side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, before the sun rose, the king sprang from his bed, and told
      his wife he must have another game with the Gruagach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If my father loses that game, and you win it,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;accept nothing
      for your prize but the shaggy young horse with the stick saddle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will do that,&rsquo; answered the king, and he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does your bride please you?&rsquo; asked the Gruagach, who was standing at his
      own door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! does she not!&rsquo; answered the king quickly. &lsquo;Otherwise I should be hard
      indeed to please. But will you play a game to-day?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; replied the Gruagach, and they played, and sometimes it seemed
      as if one would win, and sometimes the other, but in the end the king was
      the winner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the prize that you will choose?&rsquo; asked the Gruagach.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The shaggy young horse with the stick saddle,&rsquo; answered the king, but he
      noticed that the Gruagach held his peace, and his brow was dark as he led
      out the horse from the stable. Rough was its mane and dull was its skin,
      but the king cared nothing for that, and throwing his leg over the stick
      saddle, rode away like the wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the third morning the king got up as usual before dawn, and as soon as
      he had eaten food he prepared to go out, when his wife stopped him. &lsquo;I
      would rather,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;that you did not go to play with the Gruagach,
      for though twice you have won yet some day he will win, and then he will
      put trouble upon you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I must have one more game,&rsquo; cried the king; &lsquo;just this one.&rsquo; And he
      went off to the house of the Gruagach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joy filled the heart of the Gruagach when he saw him coming, and without
      waiting to talk they played their game. Somehow or other, the king&rsquo;s
      strength and skill had departed from him, and soon the Gruagach was the
      victor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Choose your prize,&rsquo; said the king, when the game was ended, &lsquo;but do not
      be too hard on me, or ask what I cannot give.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The prize I choose,&rsquo; answered the Gruagach, &lsquo;is that the crop-headed
      creature should take thy head and thy neck, if thou dost not get for me
      the Sword of Light that hangs in the house of the king of the oak
      windows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will get it,&rsquo; replied the young man bravely; but as soon as he was out
      of sight of the Gruagach he pretended no more, and his face grew dark and
      his steps lagging.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have brought nothing with you to-night,&rsquo; said the queen, who was
      standing on the steps awaiting him. She was so beautiful that the king was
      fain to smile when he looked at her, but then he remembered what had
      happened, and his heart grew heavy again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it? What is the matter? Tell me thy sorrow that I may bear it
      with thee, or, it may be, help thee!&rsquo; Then the king told her everything
      that had befallen him, and she stroked his hair the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is nothing to grieve about,&rsquo; she said when the tale was finished.
      &lsquo;You have the best wife in Erin, and the best horse in Erin. Only do as I
      bid you, and all will go well.&rsquo; And the king suffered himself to be
      comforted.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still sleeping when the queen rose and dressed herself, to make
      everything ready for her husband&rsquo;s journey; and the first place she went
      to was the stable, where she fed and watered the shaggy brown horse and
      put the saddle on it. Most people thought this saddle was of wood, and did
      not see the little sparkles of gold and silver that were hidden in it. She
      strapped it lightly on the horse&rsquo;s back, and then led it down before the
      house, where the king waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good luck to you, and victories in all your battles,&rsquo; she said, as she
      kissed him before he mounted. &lsquo;I need not be telling you anything. Take
      the advice of the horse, and see you obey it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So he waved his hand and set out on his journey, and the wind was not
      swifter than the brown horse&mdash;no, not even the March wind which raced
      it and could not catch it. But the horse never stopped nor looked behind,
      till in the dark of the night he reached the castle of the king of the oak
      windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are at the end of the journey,&rsquo; said the horse, &lsquo;and you will find the
      Sword of Light in the king&rsquo;s own chamber. If it comes to you without
      scrape or sound, the token is a good one. At this hour the king is eating
      his supper, and the room is empty, so none will see you. The sword has a
      knob at the end, and take heed that when you grasp it, you draw it softly
      out of its sheath. Now go! I will be under the window.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Stealthily the young man crept along the passage, pausing now and then to
      make sure that no man was following him, and entered the king&rsquo;s chamber. A
      strange white line of light told him where the sword was, and crossing the
      room on tiptoe, he seized the knob, and drew it slowly out of the sheath.
      The king could hardly breathe with excitement lest it should make some
      noise, and bring all the people in the castle running to see what was the
      matter. But the sword slid swiftly and silently along the case till only
      the point was left touching it. Then a low sound was heard, as of the edge
      of a knife touching a silver plate, and the king was so startled that he
      nearly dropped the knob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quick! quick!&rsquo; cried the horse, and the king scrambled hastily through
      the small window, and leapt into the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has heard and he will follow,&rsquo; said the horse; &lsquo;but we have a good
      start,&rsquo; And on they sped, on and on, leaving the winds behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the horse slackened its pace. &lsquo;Look and see who is behind you,&rsquo; 
      it said; and the young man looked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see a swarm of brown horses racing madly after us,&rsquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are swifter than those,&rsquo; said the horse, and flew on again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look again, O king! Is anyone coming now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A swarm of black horses, and one has a white face, and on that horse a
      man is seated. He is the king of the oak windows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is my brother, and swifter still than I,&rsquo; said the horse, &lsquo;and he
      will fly past me with a rush. Then you must have your sword ready, and
      take off the head of the man who sits on him, as he turns and looks at
      you. And there is no sword in the world that will cut off his head, save
      only that one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will do it,&rsquo; replied the king; and he listened with all his might, till
      he judged that the white-faced horse was close to him. Then he sat up very
      straight and made ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next moment there was a rushing noise as of a mighty tempest, and the
      young man caught a glimpse of a face turned towards him. Almost blindly he
      struck, not knowing whether he had killed or only wounded the rider. But
      the head rolled off, and was caught in the brown horse&rsquo;s mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jump on my brother, the black horse, and go home as fast as you can, and
      I will follow as quickly as I may,&rsquo; cried the brown horse; and leaping
      forward the king alighted on the back of the black horse, but so near the
      tail that he almost fell off again. But he stretched out his arm and
      clutched wildly at the mane and pulled himself into the saddle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the sky was streaked with red he was at home again, and the queen
      was sitting waiting till he arrived, for sleep was far from her eyes. Glad
      was she to see him enter, but she said little, only took her harp and sang
      softly the songs which he loved, till he went to bed, soothed and happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was broad day when he woke, and he sprang up saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I must go to the Gruagach, to find out if the spells he laid on me
      are loose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have a care,&rsquo; answered the queen, &lsquo;for it is not with a smile as on the
      other days that he will greet you. Furiously he will meet you, and will
      ask you in his wrath if you have got the sword, and you will reply that
      you have got it. Next he will want to know how you got it, and to this you
      must say that but for the knob you had not got it at all. Then he will
      raise his head to look at the knob, and you must stab him in the mole
      which is on the right side of his neck; but take heed, for if you miss the
      mole with the point of the sword, then my death and your death are
      certain. He is brother to the king of the oak windows, and sure will he be
      that the king must be head, or the sword would not be in your hands.&rsquo; 
      After that she kissed him, and bade him good speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didst thou get the sword?&rsquo; asked the Gruagach, when they met in the usual
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I got the sword.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how didst thou get it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it had not had a knob on the top, then I had not got it,&rsquo; answered the
      king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me the sword to look at,&rsquo; said the Gruagach, peering forward; but
      like a flash the king had drawn it from under his nose and pierced the
      mole, so that the Gruagach rolled over on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I shall be at peace,&rsquo; thought the king. But he was wrong, for when he
      reached home he found his servants tied together back to back with cloths
      bound round their mouths, so that they could not speak. He hastened to set
      them free, and he asked who had treated them in so evil a manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No sooner had you gone than a great giant came, and dealt with us as you
      see, and carried off your wife and your two horses,&rsquo; said the men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then my eyes will not close nor will my head lay itself down till I fetch
      my wife and horses home again,&rsquo; answered he, and he stopped and noted the
      tracks of the horses on the grass, and followed after them till he arrived
      at the wood, when the darkness fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will sleep here,&rsquo; he said to himself, &lsquo;but first I will make a fire,&rsquo; 
      And he gathered together some twigs that were lying about, and then took
      two dry sticks and rubbed them together till the fire came, and he sat by
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twigs cracked and the flame blazed up, and a slim yellow dog pushed
      through the bushes and laid his head on the king&rsquo;s knee, and the king
      stroked his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wuf, wuf,&rsquo; said the dog. &lsquo;Sore was the plight of thy wife and thy horses
      when the giant drove them last night through the forest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is why I have come,&rsquo; answered the king; and suddenly his heart
      seemed to fail him and he felt that he could not go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot fight that giant,&rsquo; he cried, looking at the dog with a white
      face. &lsquo;I am afraid, let me turn homewards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t do that,&rsquo; replied the dog. &lsquo;Eat and sleep, and I will watch
      over you.&rsquo; So the king ate and lay down, and slept till the sun waked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is time for you to start on your way,&rsquo; said the dog, &lsquo;and if danger
      presses, call on me, and I will help you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Farewell, then,&rsquo; answered the king; &lsquo;I will not forget that promise,&rsquo; and
      on he went, and on, and on, till he reached a tall cliff with many sticks
      lying about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is almost night,&rsquo; he thought; &lsquo;I will make a fire and rest,&rsquo; and thus
      he did, and when the flames blazed up, the hoary hawk of the grey rock
      flew on to a bough above him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sore was the plight of thy wife and thy horses when they passed here with
      the giant,&rsquo; said the hawk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never shall I find them,&rsquo; answered the king, &lsquo;and nothing shall I get for
      all my trouble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, take heart,&rsquo; replied the hawk; &lsquo;things are never so bad but what they
      might be worse. Eat and sleep and I will watch thee,&rsquo; and the king did as
      he was bidden by the hawk, and by the morning he felt brave again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Farewell,&rsquo; said the bird, &lsquo;and if danger presses call to me, and I will
      help you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On he walked, and on and on, till as dusk was falling he came to a great
      river, and on the bank there were sticks lying about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will make myself a fire,&rsquo; he thought, and thus he did, and by and bye a
      smooth brown head peered at him from the water, and a long body followed
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sore was the plight of thy wife and thy horses when they passed the river
      last night,&rsquo; said the otter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have sought them and not found them,&rsquo; answered the king, &lsquo;and nought
      shall I get for my trouble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be not so downcast,&rsquo; replied the otter; &lsquo;before noon to-morrow thou shalt
      behold thy wife. But eat and sleep and I will watch over thee.&rsquo; So the
      king did as the otter bid him, and when the sun rose he woke and saw the
      otter lying on the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Farewell,&rsquo; cried the otter as he jumped into the water, &lsquo;and if danger
      presses, call to me and I will help you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For many hours the king walked, and at length he reached a high rock,
      which was rent into two by a great earthquake. Throwing himself on the
      ground he looked over the side, and right at the very bottom he saw his
      wife and his horses. His heart gave a great bound, and all his fears left
      him, but he was forced to be patient, for the sides of the rock were
      smooth, and not even a goat could find foothold. So he got up again, and
      made his way round through the wood, pushing by trees, scrambling over
      rocks, wading through streams, till at last he was on flat ground again,
      close to the mouth of the cavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife gave a shriek of joy when he came in, and then burst into tears,
      for she was tired and very frightened. But her husband did not understand
      why she wept, and he was tired and bruised from his climb, and a little
      cross too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You give me but a sorry welcome,&rsquo; grumbled he, &lsquo;when I have half-killed
      myself to get to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not heed him,&rsquo; said the horses to the weeping woman; &lsquo;put him in front
      of us, where he will be safe, and give him food, for he is weary.&rsquo; And she
      did as the horses told her, and he ate and rested, till by and bye a long
      shadow fell over them, and their hearts beat with fear, for they knew that
      the giant was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I smell a stranger,&rsquo; cried the giant, as he entered; but it was dark
      inside the chasm, and he did not see the king, who was crouching down
      between the feet of the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A stranger, my lord! no stranger ever comes here, not even the sun!&rsquo; and
      the king&rsquo;s wife laughed gaily as she went up to the giant and stroked the
      huge hand which hung down by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I perceive nothing, certainly,&rsquo; answered he, &lsquo;but it is very odd.
      However, it is time that the horses were fed;&rsquo; and he lifted down an
      armful of hay from a shelf of rock and held out a handful to each animal,
      who moved forward to meet him, leaving the king behind. As soon as the
      giant&rsquo;s hands were near their mouths they each made a snap, and began to
      bit them, so that his groans and shrieks might have been heard a mile off.
      Then they wheeled round and kicked him till they could kick no more. At
      length the giant crawled away, and lay quivering in a corner, and the
      queen went up to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor thing! poor thing!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;they seem to have gone mad; it was
      awful to behold.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I had had my soul in my body they would certainly have killed me,&rsquo; 
      groaned the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was lucky indeed,&rsquo; answered the queen; &lsquo;but tell me, where is thy
      soul, that I may take care of it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Up there, in the Bonnach stone,&rsquo; answered the giant, pointing to a stone
      which was balanced loosely on an edge of rock. &lsquo;But now leave me, that I
      may sleep, for I have far to go to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon snores were heard from the corner where the giant lay, and then the
      queen lay down too, and the horses, and the king was hidden between them,
      so that none could see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the dawn the giant rose and went out, and immediately the queen ran
      up to the Bonnach stone, and tugged and pushed at it till it was quite
      steady on its ledge, and could not fall over. And so it was in the evening
      when the giant came home; and when they saw his shadow, the king crept
      down in front of the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what have you done to the Bonnach stone?&rsquo; asked the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feared lest it should fall over, and be broken, with your soul in it,&rsquo; 
      said the queen, &lsquo;so I put it further back on the ledge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not there that my soul is,&rsquo; answered he, &lsquo;it is on the threshold.
      But it is time the horses were fed;&rsquo; and he fetched the hay, and gave it
      to them, and they bit and kicked him as before, till he lay half dead on
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he rose and went out, and the queen ran to the threshold of
      the cave, and washed the stones, and pulled up some moss and little
      flowers that were hidden in the crannies, and by and bye when dusk had
      fallen the giant came home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been cleaning the threshold,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And was I not right to do it, seeing that your soul is in it?&rsquo; asked the
      queen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not there that my soul is,&rsquo; answered the giant. &lsquo;Under the
      threshold is a stone, and under the stone is a sheep, and in the sheep&rsquo;s
      body is a duck, and in the duck is an egg, and in the egg is my soul. But
      it is late, and I must feed the horses;&rsquo; and he brought them the hay, but
      they only bit and kicked him as before, and if his soul had been within
      him, they would have killed him outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was still dark when the giant got up and went his way, and then the
      king and the queen ran forward to take up the threshold, while the horses
      looked on. But sure enough! just as the giant had said, underneath the
      threshold was the flagstone, and they pulled and tugged till the stone
      gave way. Then something jumped out so suddenly, that it nearly knocked
      them down, and as it fled past, they saw it was a sheep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the slim yellow dog of the greenwood were only here, he would soon
      have that sheep,&rsquo; cried the king; and as he spoke, the slim yellow dog
      appeared from the forest, with the sheep in his mouth. With a blow from
      the king, the sheep fell dead, and they opened its body, only to be
      blinded by a rush of wings as the duck flew past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the hoary hawk of the rock were only here, he would soon have that
      duck,&rsquo; cried the king; and as he spoke the hoary hawk was seen hovering
      above them, with the duck in his mouth. They cut off the duck&rsquo;s head with
      a swing of the king&rsquo;s sword, and took the egg out of its body, but in his
      triumph the king held it carelessly, and it slipped from his hand, and
      rolled swiftly down the hill right into the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the brown otter of the stream were only here, he would soon have that
      egg,&rsquo; cried the king; and the next minute there was the brown otter,
      dripping with water, holding the egg in his mouth. But beside the brown
      otter, a huge shadow came stealing along&mdash;the shadow of the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king stood staring at it, as if he were turned into stone, but the
      queen snatched the egg from the otter and crushed it between her two
      hands. And after that the shadow suddenly shrank and was still, and they
      knew that the giant was dead, because they had found his soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day they mounted the two horses and rode home again, visiting their
      friends the brown otter and the hoary hawk and the slim yellow dog by the
      way.

    <h2>
      A French Puck
    </h2>
    <p>
      Among the mountain pastures and valleys that lie in the centre of France
      there dwelt a mischievous kind of spirit, whose delight it was to play
      tricks on everybody, and particularly on the shepherds and the cowboys.
      They never knew when they were safe from him, as he could change himself
      into a man, woman or child, a stick, a goat, a ploughshare. Indeed, there
      was only one thing whose shape he could not take, and that was a needle.
      At least, he could transform himself into a needle, but try as he might he
      never was able to imitate the hole, so every woman would have found him
      out at once, and this he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the hour oftenest chosen by this naughty sprite (whom we will call
      Puck) for performing his pranks was about midnight, just when the
      shepherds and cowherds, tired out with their long day&rsquo;s work, were sound
      asleep. Then he would go into the cowsheds and unfasten the chains that
      fixed each beast in its own stall, and let them fall with a heavy clang to
      the ground. The noise was so loud that it was certain to awaken the
      cowboys, however fatigued they might be, and they dragged themselves
      wearily to the stable to put back the chains. But no sooner had they
      returned to their beds than the same thing happened again, and so on till
      the morning. Or perhaps Puck would spend his night in plaiting together
      the manes and tails of two of the horses, so that it would take the grooms
      hours of labour to get them right in the morning, while Puck, hidden among
      the hay in the loft, would peep out to watch them, enjoying himself
      amazingly all the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening more than eighty years ago a man named William was passing
      along the bank of a stream when he noticed a sheep who was bleating
      loudly. William thought it must have strayed from the flock, and that he
      had better take it home with him till he could discover its owner. So he
      went up to where it was standing, and as it seemed so tired that it could
      hardly walk, he hoisted it on his shoulders and continued on his way. The
      sheep was pretty heavy, but the good man was merciful and staggered along
      as best he could under his load.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not much further,&rsquo; he thought to himself as he reached an avenue of
      walnut trees, when suddenly a voice spoke out from over his head, and made
      him jump.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are you?&rsquo; said the voice, and the sheep answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here on the shoulders of a donkey.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In another moment the sheep was standing on the ground and William was
      running towards home as fast as his legs would carry him. But as he went,
      a laugh, which yet was something of a bleat, rang in his ears, and though
      he tried not to hear, the words reached him, &lsquo;Oh, dear! What fun I have
      had, to be sure!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Puck was careful not always to play his tricks in the same place, but
      visited one village after another, so that everyone trembled lest he
      should be the next victim. After a bit he grew tired of cowboys and
      shepherds, and wondered if there was no one else to give him some sport.
      At length he was told of a young couple who were going to the nearest town
      to buy all that they needed for setting up house. Quite certain that they
      would forget something which they could not do without, Puck waited
      patiently till they were jogging along in their cart on their return
      journey, and changed himself into a fly in order to overhear their
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time it was very dull&mdash;all about their wedding day next
      month, and who were to be invited. This led the bride to her wedding
      dress, and she gave a little scream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just think! Oh! how could I be so stupid! I have forgotten to buy the
      different coloured reels of cotton to match my clothes!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear, dear!&rsquo; exclaimed the young man. &lsquo;That is unlucky; and didn&rsquo;t you
      tell me that the dressmaker was coming in to-morrow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I did,&rsquo; and then suddenly she gave another little scream, which had
      quite a different sound from the first. &lsquo;Look! Look!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The bridegroom looked, and on one side of the road he saw a large ball of
      thread of all colours&mdash;of all the colours, that is, of the dresses
      that were tied on to the back of the cart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that is a wonderful piece of good fortune,&rsquo; cried he, as he sprang
      out to get it. &lsquo;One would think a fairy had put it there on purpose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps she has,&rsquo; laughed the girl, and as she spoke she seemed to hear
      an echo of her laughter coming from the horse, but of course that was
      nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dressmaker was delighted with the thread that was given her. It
      matched the stuffs so perfectly, and never tied itself in knots, or broke
      perpetually, as most thread did. She finished her work much quicker than
      she expected and the bride said she was to be sure to come to the church
      and see her in her wedding dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a great crowd assembled to witness the ceremony, for the young
      people were immense favourites in the neighbourhood, and their parents
      were very rich. The doors were open, and the bride could be seen from
      afar, walking under the chestnut avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a beautiful girl!&rsquo; exclaimed the men. &lsquo;What a lovely dress!&rsquo; 
      whispered the women. But just as she entered the church and took the hand
      of the bridegroom, who was waiting for her, a loud noise was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Crick! crack! Crick! crack!&rsquo; and the wedding garments fell to the ground,
      to the great confusion of the wearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that the ceremony was put off for a little thing like that! Cloaks in
      profusion were instantly offered to the young bride, but she was so upset
      that she could hardly keep from tears. One of the guests, more curious
      than the rest, stayed behind to examine the dress, determined, if she
      could, to find out the cause of the disaster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The thread must have been rotten,&rsquo; she said to herself. &lsquo;I will see if I
      can break it.&rsquo; But search as she would she could find none.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thread had vanished!

    <h2>
      The Three Crowns
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was once a king who had three daughters. The two eldest were very
      proud and quarrelsome, but the youngest was as good as they were bad.
      Well, three princes came to court them, and two of them were exactly like
      the eldest ladies, and one was just as lovable as the youngest. One day
      they were all walking down to a lake that lay at the bottom of the lawn
      when they met a poor beggar. The king wouldn&rsquo;t give him anything, and the
      eldest princesses wouldn&rsquo;t give him anything, nor their sweethearts; but
      the youngest daughter and her true love did give him something, and kind
      words along with it, and that was better than all.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they got to the edge of the lake what did they find but the
      beautifullest boat you ever saw in your life; and says the eldest, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll
      take a sail in this fine boat&rsquo;; and says the second eldest, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take a
      sail in this fine boat&rsquo;; and says the youngest, &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t take a sail in
      that fine boat, for I am afraid it&rsquo;s an enchanted one.&rsquo; But the others
      persuaded her to go in, and her father was just going in after her, when
      up sprung on the deck a little man only seven inches high, and ordered him
      to stand back. Well, all the men put their hands to their swords; and if
      the same swords were only playthings, they weren&rsquo;t able to draw them, for
      all strength that was left their arms. Seven Inches loosened the silver
      chain that fastened the boat, and pushed away, and after grinning at the
      four men, says he to them. &lsquo;Bid your daughters and your brides farewell
      for awhile. You,&rsquo; says he to the youngest, &lsquo;needn&rsquo;t fear, you&rsquo;ll recover
      your princess all in good time, and you and she will be as happy as the
      day is long. Bad people, if they were rolling stark naked in gold, would
      not be rich. Good-bye.&rsquo; Away they sailed, and the ladies stretched out
      their hands, but weren&rsquo;t able to say a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, they weren&rsquo;t crossing the lake while a cat &lsquo;ud be lickin&rsquo; her ear,
      and the poor men couldn&rsquo;t stir hand or foot to follow them. They saw Seven
      Inches handing the three princesses out of the boat, and letting them down
      by a basket into a draw-well, but king nor princes ever saw an opening
      before in the same place. When the last lady was out of sight, the men
      found the strength in their arms and legs again. Round the lake they ran,
      and never drew rein till they came to the well and windlass; and there was
      the silk rope rolled on the axle, and the nice white basket hanging to it.
      &lsquo;Let me down,&rsquo; says the youngest prince. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll die or recover them again.&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; says the second daughter&rsquo;s sweetheart, &lsquo;it is my turn first.&rsquo; And
      says the other, &lsquo;I am the eldest.&rsquo; So they gave way to him, and in he got
      into the basket, and down they let him. First they lost sight of him, and
      then, after winding off a hundred perches of the silk rope, it slackened,
      and they stopped turning. They waited two hours, and then they went to
      dinner, because there was no pull made at the rope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Guards were set till next morning, and then down went the second prince,
      and sure enough, the youngest of all got himself let down on the third
      day. He went down perches and perches, while it was as dark about him as
      if he was in a big pot with a cover on. At last he saw a glimmer far down,
      and in a short time he felt the ground. Out he came from the big
      lime-kiln, and, lo! and behold you, there was a wood, and green fields,
      and a castle in a lawn, and a bright sky over all. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s in Tir-na-n-Oge I
      am,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s see what sort of people are in the castle.&rsquo; On he
      walked, across fields and lawn, and no one was there to keep him out or
      let him into the castle; but the big hall-door was wide open. He went from
      one fine room to another that was finer, and at last he reached the
      handsomest of all, with a table in the middle. And such a dinner as was
      laid upon it! The prince was hungry enough, but he was too mannerly to eat
      without being invited. So he sat by the fire, and he did not wait long
      till he heard steps, and in came Seven Inches with the youngest sister by
      the hand. Well, prince and princess flew into one another&rsquo;s arms, and says
      the little man, says he, &lsquo;Why aren&rsquo;t you eating?&rsquo; &lsquo;I think, sir,&rsquo; says the
      prince, &lsquo;it was only good manner to wait to be asked.&rsquo; &lsquo;The other princes
      didn&rsquo;t think so,&rsquo; says he. &lsquo;Each o&rsquo; them fell to without leave, and only
      gave me the rough words when I told them they were making more free than
      welcome. Well, I don&rsquo;t think they feel much hunger now. There they are,
      good marble instead of flesh and blood,&rsquo; says he, pointing to two statues,
      one in one corner, and the other in the other corner of the room. The
      prince was frightened, but he was afraid to say anything, and Seven Inches
      made him sit down to dinner between himself and his bride; and he&rsquo;d be as
      happy as the day is long, only for the sight of the stone men in the
      corner. Well, that day went by, and when the next came, says Seven Inches
      to him, &lsquo;Now, you&rsquo;ll have to set out that way,&rsquo; pointing to the sun, &lsquo;and
      you&rsquo;ll find the second princess in a giant&rsquo;s castle this evening, when
      you&rsquo;ll be tired and hungry, and the eldest princess to-morrow evening; and
      you may as well bring them here with you. You need not ask leave of their
      masters; and perhaps if they ever get home, they&rsquo;ll look on poor people as
      if they were flesh and blood like themselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Away went the prince, and bedad! it&rsquo;s tired and hungry he was when he
      reached the first castle, at sunset. Oh, wasn&rsquo;t the second princess glad
      to see him! And what a good supper she gave him. But she heard the giant
      at the gate, and she hid the prince in a closet. Well, when he came in, he
      snuffed, an&rsquo; he snuffed, and says he, &lsquo;By the life, I smell fresh meat.&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; says the princess, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s only the calf I got killed to-day.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ay,
      ay,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;is supper ready?&rsquo; &lsquo;It is,&rsquo; says she; and before he rose
      from the table he ate three-quarters of a calf, and a flask of wine. &lsquo;I
      think,&rsquo; says he, when all was done, &lsquo;I smell fresh meat still.&rsquo; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s
      sleepy you are,&rsquo; says she; &lsquo;go to bed.&rsquo; &lsquo;When will you marry me?&rsquo; says the
      giant. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re putting me off too long.&rsquo; &lsquo;St. Tibb&rsquo;s Eve,&rsquo; says she. &lsquo;I
      wish I knew how far off that is,&rsquo; says he; and he fell asleep, with his
      head in the dish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day, he went out after breakfast, and she sent the prince to the
      castle where the eldest sister was. The same thing happened there; but
      when the giant was snoring, the princess wakened up the prince, and they
      saddled two steeds in the stables and rode into the field on them. But the
      horses&rsquo; heels struck the stones outside the gate, and up got the giant and
      strode after them. He roared and he shouted, and the more he shouted, the
      faster ran the horses, and just as the day was breaking he was only twenty
      perches behind. But the prince didn&rsquo;t leave the castle of Seven Inches
      without being provided with something good. He reined in his steed, and
      flung a short, sharp knife over his shoulder, and up sprung a thick wood
      between the giant and themselves. They caught the wind that blew before
      them, and the wind that blew behind them did not catch them. At last they
      were near the castle where the other sister lived; and there she was,
      waiting for them under a high hedge, and a fine steed under her.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the giant was now in sight, roaring like a hundred lions, and the
      other giant was out in a moment, and the chase kept on. For every two
      springs the horses gave, the giants gave three, and at last they were only
      seventy perches off. Then the prince stopped again, and flung the second
      knife behind him. Down went all the flat field, till there was a quarry
      between them a quarter of a mile deep, and the bottom filled with black
      water; and before the giants could get round it, the prince and princesses
      were inside the kingdom of the great magician, where the high thorny hedge
      opened of itself to everyone that he chose to let in. There was joy enough
      between the three sisters, till the two eldest saw their lovers turned
      into stone. But while they were shedding tears for them, Seven Inches came
      in, and touched them with his rod. So they were flesh, and blood, and life
      once more, and there was great hugging and kissing, and all sat down to
      breakfast, and Seven Inches sat at the head of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      When breakfast was over, he took them into another room, where there was
      nothing but heaps of gold, and silver, and diamonds, and silks, and
      satins; and on a table there was lying three sets of crowns: a gold crown
      was in a silver crown, and that was lying in a copper crown. He took up
      one set of crowns, and gave it to the eldest princess; and another set,
      and gave it to the second youngest princess; and another, and gave it to
      the youngest of all; and says he, &lsquo;Now you may all go to the bottom of the
      pit, and you have nothing to do but stir the basket, and the people that
      are watching above will draw you up. But remember, ladies, you are to keep
      your crows safe, and be married in them, all the same day. If you be
      married separately, or if you be married without your crowns, a curse will
      follow&mdash;mind what I say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they took leave of him with great respect, and walked arm-in-arm to the
      bottom of the draw-well. There was a sky and a sun over them, and a great
      high wall, covered with ivy, rose before them, and was so high they could
      not see to the top of it; and there was an arch in this wall, and the
      bottom of the draw-well was inside the arch. The youngest pair went last;
      and says the princess to the prince, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure the two princes don&rsquo;t mean
      any good to you. Keep these crowns under your cloak, and if you are
      obliged to stay last, don&rsquo;t get into the basket, but put a big stone, or
      any heavy thing inside, and see what will happen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as they were inside the dark cave, they put in the eldest princess
      first, and stirred the basket, and up she went. Then the basket was let
      down again, and up went the second princess, and then up went the
      youngest; but first she put her arms round her prince&rsquo;s neck, and kissed
      him, and cried a little. At last it came to the turn of the youngest
      prince, and instead of going into the basket he put in a big stone. He
      drew on one side and listened, and after the basket was drawn up about
      twenty perches, down came it and the stone like thunder, and the stone was
      broken into little bits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the poor prince had nothing for it but to walk back to the castle;
      and through it and round it he walked, and the finest of eating and
      drinking he got, and a bed of bog-down to sleep on, and long walks he took
      through gardens and lawns, but not a sight could he get, high or low, of
      Seven Inches. He, before a week, got tired of it, he was so lonesome for
      his true love; and at the end of a month he didn&rsquo;t know what to do with
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning he went into the treasure room, and took notice of a beautiful
      snuff-box on the table that he didn&rsquo;t remember seeing there before. He
      took it in his hands and opened it, and out Seven Inches walked on the
      table. &lsquo;I think, prince,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re getting a little tired of my
      castle?&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; says the other, &lsquo;if I had my princess here, and could see
      you now and then, I&rsquo;d never know a dismal day.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, you&rsquo;re long enough
      here now, and you&rsquo;re wanted there above. Keep your bride&rsquo;s crowns safe,
      and whenever you want my help, open this snuff-box. Now take a walk down
      the garden, and come back when you&rsquo;re tired.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The prince was going down a gravel walk with a quickset hedge on each
      side, and his eyes on the ground, and he was thinking of one thing and
      another. At last he lifted his eyes, and there he was outside of a smith&rsquo;s
      gate that he often passed before, about a mile away from the palace of his
      betrothed princess. The clothes he had on him were as ragged as you
      please, but he had his crowns safe under his old cloak.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the smith came out, and says he, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a shame for a strong, big
      fellow like you to be lazy, and so much work to be done. Are you any good
      with hammer and tongs? Come in and bear a hand, an I&rsquo;ll give you diet and
      lodging, and a few pence when you earn them.&rsquo; &lsquo;Never say&rsquo;t twice,&rsquo; says
      the prince. &lsquo;I want nothing but to be busy.&rsquo; So he took the hammer, and
      pounded away at the red-hot bar that the smith was turning on the anvil to
      make into a set of horse-shoes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They hadn&rsquo;t been long at work when a tailor came in, and he sat down and
      began to talk. &lsquo;You all heard how the two princess were loth to be married
      till the youngest would be ready with her crowns and her sweetheart. But
      after the windlass loosened accidentally when they were pulling up her
      bridegroom that was to be, there was no more sign of a well, or a rope, or
      a windlass, than there is on the palm of your hand. So the princes that
      were courting the eldest ladies wouldn&rsquo;t give peace or ease to their
      lovers nor the king till they got consent to the marriage, and it was to
      take place this morning. Myself went down out o&rsquo; curiousity, and to be
      sure I was delighted with the grand dresses of the two brides, and the
      three crowns on their heads&mdash;gold, silver, and copper, one inside the
      other. The youngest was standing by mournful enough, and all was ready.
      The two bridegrooms came in as proud and grand as you please, and up they
      were walking to the altar rails, when the boards opened two yards wide
      under their feet, and down they went among the dead men and the coffins in
      the vaults. Oh, such shrieks as the ladies gave! and such running and
      racing and peeping down as there was! but the clerk soon opened the door
      of the vault, and up came the two princes, their fine clothes covered an
      inch thick with cobwebs and mould.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the king said they should put off the marriage. &lsquo;For,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I see
      there is no use in thinking of it till the youngest gets her three crowns,
      and is married with the others. I&rsquo;ll give my youngest daughter for a wife
      to whoever brings three crowns to me like the others; and if he doesn&rsquo;t
      care to be married, some other one will, and I&rsquo;ll make his fortune.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish,&rsquo; says the smith, &lsquo;I could do it; but I was looking at the crowns
      after the princesses got home, and I don&rsquo;t think there&rsquo;s a black or a
      white smith on the face of the earth that could imitate them.&rsquo; &lsquo;Faint
      heart never won fair lady,&rsquo; says the prince. &lsquo;Go to the palace and ask for
      a quarter of a pound of gold, a quarter of a pound of silver, and a
      quarter of a pound of copper. Get one crown for a pattern, and my head for
      a pledge, I&rsquo;ll give you out the very things that are wanted in the
      morning.&rsquo; &lsquo;Are you in earnest?&rsquo; says the smith. &lsquo;Faith, I am so,&rsquo; says he.
      &lsquo;Go! you can&rsquo;t do worse than lose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To make a long story short, the smith got the quarter of a pound of gold,
      and the quarter of a pound of silver, and the quarter of a pound of
      copper, and gave them and the pattern crown to the prince. He shut the
      forge door at nightfall, and the neighbours all gathered in the yard, and
      they heard him hammering, hammering, hammering, from that to daybreak; and
      every now and then he&rsquo;d throw out through the window bits of gold, silver,
      and copper; and the idlers scrambled for them, and cursed one another, and
      prayed for the good luck of the workman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, just as the sun was thinking to rise, he opened the door, and
      brought out the three crowns he got from his true love, and such shouting
      and huzzaing as there was! The smith asked him to go along with him to the
      palace, but he refused; so off set the smith, and the whole townland with
      him; and wasn&rsquo;t the king rejoiced when he saw the crowns! &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says he
      to the smith, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re a married man. What&rsquo;s to be done?&rsquo; &lsquo;Faith, your
      majesty, I didn&rsquo;t make them crowns at all. It was a big fellow that took
      service with me yesterday.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, daughter, will you marry the fellow
      that made these crowns?&rsquo; &lsquo;Let me see them first, father,&rsquo; said she; but
      when she examined them she knew them right well, and guessed it was her
      true love that sent them. &lsquo;I will marry the man that these crowns came
      from,&rsquo; says she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says the king to the elder of the two princes, &lsquo;go up to the
      smith&rsquo;s forge, take my best coaches, and bring home the bridegroom.&rsquo; He
      did not like doing this, he was so proud, but he could not refuse. When he
      came to the forge he saw the prince standing at the door, and beckoned him
      over to the coach. &lsquo;Are you the fellow,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;that made these
      crowns?&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; says the other. &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;maybe you&rsquo;d give
      yourself a brushing, and get into that coach; the king wants to see you. I
      pity the princess.&rsquo; The young prince got into the carriage, and while they
      were on the way he opened the snuff-box, and out walked Seven Inches, and
      stood on his thigh. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;what trouble is on you now?&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Master,&rsquo; says the other, &lsquo;please let me go back to my forge, and let this
      carriage be filled with paving stones.&rsquo; No sooner said than done. The
      prince was sitting in his forge, and the horses wondered what was after
      happening to the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they came into the palace yard, the king himself opened the carriage
      door, for respect to his new son-in-law. As soon as he turned the handle,
      a shower of small stones fell on his powdered wig and his silk coat, and
      down he fell under them. There was great fright and some laughter, and the
      king, after he wiped the blood from his forehead, looked very cross at the
      eldest prince. &lsquo;My lord,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry for this accident, but
      I&rsquo;m not to blame. I saw the young smith get into the carriage, and we
      never stopped a minute since.&rsquo; &lsquo;It&rsquo;s uncivil you were to him. Go,&rsquo; says he
      to the other prince, &lsquo;and bring the young smith here, and be polite.&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Never fear,&rsquo; says he.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there&rsquo;s some people that couldn&rsquo;t be good-natured if they tried, and
      not a bit civiller was the new messenger than the old, and when the king
      opened the carriage door a second time, it&rsquo;s shower of mud that came down
      on him. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no use,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;going on this way. The fox never got a
      better messenger than himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So he changed his clothes, and washed himself, and out he set to the
      prince&rsquo;s forge and asked him to sit along with himself. The prince begged
      to be allowed to sit in the other carriage, and when they were half-way he
      opened his snuff-box. &lsquo;Master,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;I&rsquo;d wish to be dressed now
      according to my rank.&rsquo; &lsquo;You shall be that,&rsquo; says Seven Inches. &lsquo;And now
      I&rsquo;ll bid you farewell. Continue as good and kind as you always were; love
      your wife; and that&rsquo;s all the advice I&rsquo;ll give you.&rsquo; So Seven Inches
      vanished; and when the carriage door was opened in the yard, out walks the
      prince as fine as hands could make him, and the first thing he did was to
      run over to his bride and embrace her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one was full of joy but the two other princes. There was not much
      delay about the marriages, and they were all celebrated on the one day.
      Soon after, the two elder couples went to their own courts, but the
      youngest pair stayed with the old king, and they were as happy as the
      happiest married couple you ever heard of in a story.

    <h2>
      The Story of a Very Bad Boy
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once upon a time there lived in a little village in the very middle of
      France a widow and her only son, a boy about fifteen, whose name was
      Antoine, though no one ever called him anything but Toueno-Boueno. They
      were very poor indeed, and their hut shook about their ears on windy
      nights, till they expected the walls to fall in and crush them, but
      instead of going to work as a boy of his age ought to do, Toueno-Boueno
      did nothing but lounge along the street, his eyes fixed on the ground,
      seeing nothing that went on round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are very, very stupid, my dear child,&rsquo; his mother would sometimes say
      to him, and then she would add with a laugh, &lsquo;Certainly you will never
      catch a wolf by the tail.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the old woman bade Antoine go into the forest and collect enough
      dry leaves to make beds for herself and him. Before he had finished it
      began to rain heavily, so he hid himself in the hollow trunk of a tree,
      where he was so dry and comfortable that he soon fell fast asleep. By and
      by he was awakened by a noise which sounded like a dog scratching at the
      door, and he suddenly felt frightened, why he did not know. Very
      cautiously he raised his head, and right above him he saw a big hairy
      animal, coming down tail foremost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the wolf that they talk so much about,&rsquo; he said to himself, and he
      made himself as small as he could and shrunk into a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wolf came down the inside of the tree, slowly, slowly; Antoine felt
      turned to stone, so terrified was he, and hardly dared to breathe.
      Suddenly an idea entered his mind, which he thought might save him still.
      He remembered to have heard from his mother that a wolf could neither bend
      his back nor turn his head, so as to look behind him, and quick as
      lightning he stretched up his hand, and seizing the wolf&rsquo;s tail, pulled it
      towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he left the tree and dragged the animal to his mother&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother, you have often declared that I was too stupid to catch a wolf by
      the tail. Now see,&rsquo; he cried triumphantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, wonders will never cease,&rsquo; answered the good woman, who took
      care to keep at a safe distance. &lsquo;But as you really have got him, let us
      see if we can&rsquo;t put him to some use. Fetch the skin of the ram which died
      last week out of the chest, and we will sew the wolf up in it. He will
      make a splendid ram, and to-morrow we will drive him to the fair and sell
      him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Very likely the wolf, who was cunning and clever, may have understood what
      she said, but he thought it best to give no sign, and suffered the skin to
      be sewn upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can always get away if I choose,&rsquo; thought he, &lsquo;it is better not to be
      in a hurry;&rsquo; so he remained quite still while the skin was drawn over his
      head, which made him very hot and uncomfortable, and resisted the
      temptation to snap off the fingers or noses that were so close to his
      mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fair was at its height next day when Toueno-Boueno arrived with his
      wolf in ram&rsquo;s clothing. All the farmers crowded round him, each offering a
      higher price than the last. Never had they beheld such a beautiful beast,
      said they, and at last, after much bargaining, he was handed over to three
      brothers for a good sum of money.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that these three brothers owned large flocks of sheep, though
      none so large and fine as the one they had just bought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My flock is the nearest,&rsquo; observed the eldest brother; &lsquo;we will leave him
      in the fold for the night, and to-morrow we will decide which pastures
      will be best for him.&rsquo; And the wolf grinned as he listened, and held up
      his head a little higher than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early next morning the young farmer began to go his rounds, and the
      sheep-fold was the first place he visited. To his horror, the sheep were
      all stretched out dead before him, except one, which the wolf had eaten,
      bones and all. Instantly the truth flashed upon him. It was no ram that
      lay curled up in the corner pretending to be asleep (for in reality he
      could bend back and turn his head as much as he liked), but a wolf who was
      watching him out of the corner of his eye, and might spring upon him at
      any moment. So the farmer took no notice, and only thought that here was a
      fine chance of revenging himself on his next brother for a trick which he
      had played, and merely told him that the ram would not eat the grass in
      that field, and it might be well to drive him to the pasture by the river,
      where his own flock was feeding. The second brother eagerly swallowed the
      bait, and that evening the wolf was driven down to the field where the
      young man kept the sheep which had been left him by his father. By the
      next morning they also were all dead, but the second brother likewise held
      his peace, and allowed the sheep which belonged to the youngest to share
      the fate of the other two. Then they met and confessed to each other their
      disasters, and resolved to take the animal as fast as possible back to
      Toueno-Boueno, who should get a sound thrashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antoine was sitting on a plum tree belonging to a neighbour, eating the
      ripe fruit, when he saw the three young farmers coming towards him.
      Swinging himself down, he flew home to the hut, crying breathlessly,
      &lsquo;Mother, mother, the farmers are close by with the wolf. They have found
      out all about it, and will certainly kill me, and perhaps you too. But if
      you do as I tell you, I may be able to save us both. Lie down on the
      floor, and pretend to be dead, and be sure not to speak, whatever happens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus when the three brothers, each armed with a whip, entered the hut a
      few seconds later, they found a woman extended on the floor, and Toueno
      kneeling at her side, whistling loudly into her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you doing now, you rascal?&rsquo; asked the eldest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What am I doing? Oh, my poor friends, I am the most miserable creature in
      the world! I have lost the best of mothers, and I don&rsquo;t know what will
      become of me,&rsquo; and he hid his face in his hands and sobbed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what are you whistling like that for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it is the only chance. This whistle has been known to bring the
      dead back to life, and I hoped&mdash;&rsquo; here he buried his face in his
      hands again, but peeping between his fingers he saw that the brother had
      opened their six eyes as wide as saucers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look!&rsquo; he suddenly exclaimed with a cry, &lsquo;Look! I am sure I felt her body
      move! And now her nostrils are twitching. Ah! the whistle has not lost its
      power after all,&rsquo; and stooping down, Toueno whistled more loudly than
      before, so that the old woman&rsquo;s feet and hands showed signs of life, and
      she soon was able to life her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmers were so astonished at her restoration, that it was some time
      before they could speak. At length the eldest turned to the boy and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now listen to me. There is no manner of doubt that you are a young
      villain. You sold us a ram knowing full well that it was a wolf, and we
      came here to-day to pay you out for it. But if you will give us that
      whistle, we will pardon what you have done, and will leave you alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is my only treasure, and I set great store by it,&rsquo; answered the boy,
      pretending to hesitate. &lsquo;But as you wish for it so much, well, I suppose I
      can&rsquo;t refuse,&rsquo; and he held out the whistle, which the eldest brother put
      in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      Armed with the precious whistle, the three brothers returned home full of
      joy, and as they went the youngest said to the others, &lsquo;I have such a good
      idea! Our wives are all lazy and grumbling, and make our lives a burden.
      Let us give them a lesson, and kill them as soon as we get in. Of course
      we can restore them to life at once, but they will have had a rare
      fright.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, how clever you are,&rsquo; answered the other two. &lsquo;Nobody else would have
      thought of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So gaily the three husbands knocked down their three wives, who fell dead
      to the ground. Then one by one the men tried the whistle, and blew so
      loudly that it seemed as if their lungs would burst, but the women lay
      stark and stiff and never moved an eyelid. The husbands grew pale and
      cold, for they had never dreamed of this, nor meant any harm, and after a
      while they understood that their efforts were of no use, and that once
      more the boy had tricked them. With stern faces they rose to their feet,
      and taking a large sack they retraced their steps to the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time there was no escape. Toueno had been asleep, and only opened his
      eyes as they entered. Without a word on either side they thrust him into
      the sack, and tying up the mouth, the eldest threw it over his shoulder.
      After that they all set out to the river, where they intended to drown the
      boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the river was a long way off, and the day was very hot, and Antoine
      was heavy, heavier than a whole sheaf of corn. They carried him in turns,
      but even so they grew very tired and thirsty, and when a little tavern
      came in sight on the roadside, they thankfully flung the sack down on a
      bench and entered to refresh themselves. They never noticed that a beggar
      was sitting in the shade at the end of the bench, but Toueno&rsquo;s sharp ears
      caught the sound of someone eating, and as soon as the farmers had gone
      into the inn he began to groan softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; asked the beggar, drawing a little nearer. &lsquo;Why have
      they shut you up, poor boy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because they wanted to make me a bishop, and I would not consent,&rsquo; 
      answered Toueno.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; exclaimed the beggar, &lsquo;yet it isn&rsquo;t such a bad thing to be a
      bishop.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t say it is,&rsquo; replied the young rascal, &lsquo;but I should never like
      it. However, if you have any fancy for wearing a mitre, you need only
      untie the sack, and take my place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like nothing better,&rsquo; said the man, as he stooped to undo the
      big knot.
    </p>
    <p>
      So it was the beggar and not Toueno-Boueno who was flung into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the three wives were buried, and on returning from the
      cemetery, their husbands met Toueno-Boueno driving a magnificent flock of
      sheep. At the sight of him the three farmers stood still with
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! you scoundrel!&rsquo; they cried at last, &lsquo;we drowned you yesterday, and
      to-day we find you again, as well as ever!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It does seem odd, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; answered he. &lsquo;But perhaps you don&rsquo;t know
      that beneath this world there lies another yet more beautiful and far, far
      richer. Well, it was there that you sent me when you flung me into the
      river, and though I felt a little strange at first, yet I soon began to
      look about me, and to see what was happening. There I noticed that close
      to the place where I had fallen, a sheep fair was being held, and a
      bystander told me that every day horses or cattle were sold somewhere in
      the town. If I had only had the luck to be thrown into the river on the
      side of the horse fair I might have made my fortune! As it was, I had to
      content myself with buying these sheep, which you can get for nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And do you know exactly the spot in the river which lies over the horse
      fair?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As if I did not know it, when I have seen it with my own eyes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then if you do not want us to avenge our dead flocks and our murdered
      wives, you will have to throw us into the river just over the place of the
      horse fair.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well; only you must get three sacks and come with me to that rock
      which juts into the river. I will throw you in from there, and you will
      fall nearly on to the horses&rsquo; backs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So he threw them in, and as they were never seen again, no one ever knew
      into which fair they had fallen.

    <h2>
      The Brown Bear of Norway
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was once a king in Ireland, and he had three daughters, and very
      nice princesses they were. And one day, when they and their father were
      walking on the lawn, the king began to joke with them, and to ask them
      whom they would like to be married to. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have the king of Ulster for a
      husband,&rsquo; says one; &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll have the king of Munster,&rsquo; says another;
      &lsquo;and,&rsquo; says the youngest, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll have no husband but the Brown Bear of
      Norway.&rsquo; For a nurse of hers used to be telling her of an enchanted prince
      that she called by that name, and she fell in love with him, and his name
      was the first name on her tongue, for the very night before she was
      dreaming of him. Well, one laughed, and another laughed, and they joked
      with the princess all the rest of the evening. But that very night she
      woke up out of her sleep in a great hall that was lighted up with a
      thousand lamps; the richest carpets were on the floor, and the walls were
      covered with cloth of gold and silver, and the place was full of grand
      company, and the very beautiful prince she saw in her dreams was there,
      and it wasn&rsquo;t a moment till he was on one knee before her, and telling her
      how much he loved her, and asking her wouldn&rsquo;t she be his queen. Well, she
      hadn&rsquo;t the heart to refuse him, and married they were the same evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, my darling,&rsquo; says he, when they were left by themselves, &lsquo;you must
      know that I am under enchantment. A sorceress, that had a beautiful
      daughter, wished me for her son-in-law; but the mother got power over me,
      and when I refused to wed her daughter she made me take the form of a bear
      by day, and I was to continue so till a lady would marry me of her own
      free will, and endure five years of great trials after.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, when the princess woke in the morning, she missed her husband from
      her side, and spent the day very sadly. But as soon as the lamps were
      lighted in the grand hall, where she was sitting on a sofa covered with
      silk, the folding doors flew open, and he was sitting by her side the next
      minute. So they spent another happy evening, but he warned her that
      whenever she began to tire of him, or ceased to have faith in him, they
      would be parted for ever, and he&rsquo;d be obliged to marry the witch&rsquo;s
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She got used to find him absent by day, and they spent a happy twelvemonth
      together, and at last a beautiful little boy was born; and happy as she
      was before, she was twice as happy now, for she had her child to keep her
      company in the day when she couldn&rsquo;t see her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, one evening, when herself, and himself, and her child were
      sitting with a window open because it was a sultry night, in flew an
      eagle, took the infant&rsquo;s sash in his beak, and flew up in the air with
      him. She screamed, and was going to throw herself out the window after
      him, but the prince caught her, and looked at her very seriously. She
      bethought of what he said soon after their marriage, and she stopped the
      cries and complaints that were on her tongue. She spent her days very
      lonely for another twelvemonth, when a beautiful little girl was sent to
      her. Then she thought to herself she&rsquo;d have a sharp eye about her this
      time; so she never would allow a window to be more than a few inches open.
    </p>
    <p>
      But all her care was in vain. Another evening, when they were all so
      happy, and the prince dandling the baby, a beautiful greyhound stood
      before them, took the child out of the father&rsquo;s hand, and was out of the
      door before you could wink. This time she shouted and ran out of the room,
      but there were some of the servants in the next room, and all declared
      that neither child nor dog passed out. She felt, somehow, as if it was her
      husband&rsquo;s fault, but still she kept command over herself, and didn&rsquo;t once
      reproach him.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the third child was born she would hardly allow a window or a door to
      be left open for a moment; but she wasn&rsquo;t the nearer to keep the child to
      herself. They were sitting one evening by the fire, when a lady appeared
      standing by them. The princess opened her eyes in a great fright and
      stared at her, and while she was doing so, the lady wrapped a shawl round
      the baby that was sitting in its father&rsquo;s lap, and either sank through the
      ground with it or went up through the wide chimney. This time the mother
      kept her bed for a month.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said she to her husband, when she was beginning to recover, &lsquo;I
      think I&rsquo;d feel better if I was to see my father and mother and sisters
      once more. If you give me leave to go home for a few days I&rsquo;d be glad.&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I will do that, and whenever you feel inclined to
      return, only mention your wish when you lie down at night.&rsquo; The next
      morning when she awoke she found herself in her own old chamber in her
      father&rsquo;s palace. She rang the bell, and in a short time she had her mother
      and father and married sisters about her, and they laughed till they cried
      for joy at finding her safe back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In time she told them all that had happened to her, and they didn&rsquo;t know
      what to advise her to do. She was as fond of her husband as ever, and said
      she was sure that he couldn&rsquo;t help letting the children go; but still she
      was afraid beyond the world to have another child torn from her. Well, the
      mother and sisters consulted a wise woman that used to bring eggs to the
      castle, for they had great faith in her wisdom. She said the only plan was
      to secure the bear&rsquo;s skin that the prince was obliged to put on every
      morning, and get it burned, and then he couldn&rsquo;t help being a man night
      and day, and the enchantment would be at an end.
    </p>
    <p>
      So they all persuaded her to do that, and she promised she would; and
      after eight days she felt so great a longing to see her husband again that
      she made the wish the same night, and when she woke three hours after, she
      was in her husband&rsquo;s palace, and he himself was watching over her. There
      was great joy on both sides, and they were happy for many days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she began to think how she never minded her husband leaving her in the
      morning, and how she never found him neglecting to give her a sweet drink
      out of a gold cup just as she was going to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night she contrived not to drink any of it, though she pretended to do
      so; and she was wakeful enough in the morning, and saw her husband passing
      out through a panel in the wainscot, though she kept her eyelids nearly
      closed. The next night she got a few drops of the sleepy posset that she
      saved the evening before put into her husband&rsquo;s night drink, and that made
      him sleep sound enough. She got up after midnight, passed through the
      panel, and found a Beautiful brown bear&rsquo;s hide hanging in the corner. Then
      she stole back, and went down to the parlour fire, and put the hide into
      the middle of it till it was all fine ashes. She then lay down by her
      husband, gave him a kiss on the cheek, and fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she was to live a hundred years she&rsquo;d never forget how she wakened next
      morning, and found her husband looking down on her with misery and anger
      in his face. &lsquo;Unhappy woman,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;you have separated us for ever!
      Why hadn&rsquo;t you patience for five years? I am now obliged, whether I like
      or no, to go a three days&rsquo; journey to the witch&rsquo;s castle, and marry her
      daughter. The skin that was my guard you have burned it, and the egg-wife
      that gave you the counsel was the witch herself. I won&rsquo;t reproach you:
      your punishment will be severe without it. Farewell for ever!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He kissed her for the last time, and was off the next minute, walking as
      fast as he could. She shouted after him, and then seeing there was no use,
      she dressed herself and pursued him. He never stopped, nor stayed, nor
      looked back, and still she kept him in sight; and when he was on the hill
      she was in the hollow, and when he was in the hollow she was on the hill.
      Her life was almost leaving her, when, just as the sun was setting, he
      turned up a lane, and went into a little house. She crawled up after him,
      and when she got inside there was a beautiful little boy on his knees, and
      he kissing and hugging him. &lsquo;Here, my poor darling,&rsquo; says he, &lsquo;is your
      eldest child, and there,&rsquo; says he, pointing to a woman that was looking on
      with a smile on her face, &lsquo;is the eagle that carried him away.&rsquo; She forgot
      all her sorrows in a moment, hugging her child, and laughing and crying
      over him. The woman washed their feet, and rubbed them with an ointment
      that took all the soreness out of their bones, and made them as fresh as a
      daisy. Next morning, just before sunrise, he was up, and prepared to be
      off, &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said he to her, &lsquo;is a thing which may be of use to you. It&rsquo;s
      a scissors, and whatever stuff you cut with it will be turned into silk.
      The moment the sun rises, I&rsquo;ll lose all memory of yourself and the
      children, but I&rsquo;ll get it at sunset again. Farewell!&rsquo; But he wasn&rsquo;t far
      gone till she was in sight of him again, leaving her boy behind. It was
      the same to-day as yesterday: their shadows went before them in the
      morning and followed them in the evening. He never stopped, and she never
      stopped, and as the sun was setting he turned up another lane, and there
      they found their little daughter. It was all joy and comfort again till
      morning, and then the third day&rsquo;s journey commenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before he started he gave her a comb, and told her that whenever she
      used it, pearls and diamonds would fall from her hair. Still he had his
      memory from sunset to sunrise; but from sunrise to sunset he travelled on
      under the charm, and never threw his eye behind. This night they came to
      where the youngest baby was, and the next morning, just before sunrise,
      the prince spoke to her for the last time. &lsquo;Here, my poor wife,&rsquo; said he,
      &lsquo;is a little hand-reel, with gold thread that has no end, and the half of
      our marriage ring. If you ever get to my house, and put your half-ring to
      mine, I shall recollect you. There is a wood yonder, and the moment I
      enter it I shall forget everything that ever happened between us, just as
      if I was born yesterday. Farewell, dear wife and child, for ever!&rsquo; Just
      then the sun rose, and away he walked towards the wood. She saw it open
      before him and close after him, and when she came up, she could no more
      get in than she could break through a stone wall. She wrung her hands and
      shed tears, but then she recollected herself, and cried out, &lsquo;Wood, I
      charge you by my three magic gifts, the scissors, the comb, and the reel&mdash;to
      let me through&rsquo;; and it opened, and she went along a walk till she came in
      sight of a palace, and a lawn, and a woodman&rsquo;s cottage on the edge of the
      wood where it came nearest the palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      She went into the lodge, and asked the woodman and his wife to take her
      into their service. They were not willing at first; but she told them she
      would ask no wages, and would give them diamonds, and pearls, and silk
      stuffs, and gold thread whenever they wished for them, and then they
      agreed to let her stay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It wasn&rsquo;t long till she heard how a young prince, that was just arrived,
      was living in the palace of the young mistress. He seldom stirred abroad,
      and every one that saw him remarked how silent and sorrowful he went
      about, like a person that was searching for some lost thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servants and conceited folk at the big house began to take notice of
      the beautiful young woman at the lodge, and to annoy her with their
      impudence. The head footman was the most troublesome, and at last she
      invited him to come and take tea with her. Oh, how rejoiced he was, and
      how he bragged of it in the servants&rsquo; hall! Well, the evening came, and
      the footman walked into the lodge, and was shown to her sitting-room; for
      the lodge-keeper and his wife stood in great awe of her, and gave her two
      nice rooms for herself. Well, he sat down as stiff as a ramrod, and was
      talking in a grand style about the great doings at the castle, while she
      was getting the tea and toast ready. &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; says she to him, &lsquo;would you put
      your hand out at the window and cut me off a sprig or two of honeysuckle?&rsquo; 
      He got up in great glee, and put out his hand and head; and said she, &lsquo;By
      the virtue of my magic gifts, let a pair of horns spring out of your head,
      and sing to the lodge.&rsquo; Just as she wished, so it was. They sprung from
      the front of each ear, and met at the back. Oh, the poor wretch! And how
      he bawled and roared! and the servants that he used to be boasting to were
      soon flocking from the castle, and grinning, and huzzaing, and beating
      tunes on tongs and shovels and pans; and he cursing and swearing, and the
      eyes ready to start out of his head, and he so black in the face, and
      kicking out his legs behind him like mad.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she pitied him, and removed the charm, and the horns dropped down
      on the ground, and he would have killed her on the spot, only he was as
      weak as water, and his fellow-servants came in and carried him up to the
      big house. Well, some way or other the story came to the ears of the
      prince, and he strolled down that way. She had only the dress of a
      countrywoman on her as she sat sewing at the window, but that did not hide
      her beauty, and he was greatly puzzled after he had a good look, just as a
      body is puzzled to know whether something happened to him when he was
      young or if he only dreamed it. Well, the witch&rsquo;s daughter heard about it
      too, and she came to see the strange girl; and what did she find her doing
      but cutting out the pattern of a gown from brown paper; and as she cut
      away, the paper became the richest silk she ever saw. The witch&rsquo;s daughter
      looked on with greedy eyes, and, says she, &lsquo;What would you be satisfied to
      take for that scissors?&rsquo; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take nothing,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;but leave to
      spend one night outside the prince&rsquo;s chamber.&rsquo; Well, the proud lady fired
      up, and was going to say something dreadful; but the scissors kept on
      cutting, and the silk growing richer and richer every inch. So she
      promised what the girl had asked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When night came on she was let into the palace and lay down till the
      prince was in such a dead sleep that all she did couldn&rsquo;t awake him. She
      sung this verse to him, sighing and sobbing, and kept singing it the night
      long, and it was all in vain:
    </p>
    <p>
      Four long years I was married to thee; Three sweet babes I bore to thee;
      Brown Bear of Norway, turn to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the first dawn the proud lady was in the chamber, and led her away, and
      the footman of the horns put out his tongue at her as she was quitting the
      palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there was no luck so far; but the next day the prince passed by again
      and looked at her, and saluted her kindly, as a prince might a farmer&rsquo;s
      daughter, and passed one; and soon the witch&rsquo;s daughter passed by, and
      found her combing her hair, and pearls and diamonds dropping from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, another bargain was made, and the princess spent another night of
      sorrow, and she left the castle at daybreak, and the footman was at his
      post and enjoyed his revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third day the prince went by, and stopped to talk with the strange
      woman. He asked her could he do anything to serve her, and she said he
      might. She asked him did he ever wake at night. He said that he often did,
      but that during the last two nights he was listening to a sweet song in
      his dreams, and could not wake, and that the voice was one that he must
      have known and loved in some other world long ago. Says she, &lsquo;Did you
      drink any sleepy posset either of these evenings before you went to bed?&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;I did,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;The two evenings my wife gave me something to drink,
      but I don&rsquo;t know whether it was a sleepy posset or not.&rsquo; &lsquo;Well, prince,&rsquo; 
      said she, &lsquo;as you say you would wish to oblige me, you can do it by not
      tasting any drink to-night.&rsquo; &lsquo;I will not,&rsquo; says he, and then he went on
      his walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the great lady came soon after the prince, and found the stranger
      using her hand-reel and winding threads of gold off it, and the third
      bargain was made.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening the prince was lying on his bed at twilight, and his mind
      much disturbed; and the door opened, and in his princess walked, and down
      she sat by his bedside and sung:
    </p>
    <p>
      Four long years I was married to thee; Three sweet babes I bore to thee;
      Brown Bear of Norway, turn to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brown Bear of Norway!&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      remember, prince, that I was your wedded wife for four years?&rsquo; &lsquo;I do not,&rsquo; 
      said he, &lsquo;but I&rsquo;m sure I wish it was so.&rsquo; &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember our three
      babes that are still alive?&rsquo; &lsquo;Show me them. My mind is all a heap of
      confusion.&rsquo; &lsquo;Look for the half of our marriage ring, that hangs at your
      neck, and fit it to this.&rsquo; He did so, and the same moment the charm was
      broken. His full memory came back on him, and he flung his arms round his
      wife&rsquo;s neck, and both burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, there was a great cry outside, and the castle walls were heard
      splitting and cracking. Everyone in the castle was alarmed, and made their
      way out. The prince and princess went with the rest, and by the time all
      were safe on the lawn, down came the building, and made the ground tremble
      for miles round. No one ever saw the witch and her daughter afterwards. It
      was not long till the prince and princess had their children with them,
      and then they set out for their own palace. The kings of Ireland and of
      Munster and Ulster, and their wives, soon came to visit them, and may
      every one that deserves it be as happy as the Brown Bear of Norway and his
      family.

    <h2>
      Little Lasse
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was once a little boy whose name was Lars, and because he was so
      little he was called Little Lasse; he was a brave little man, for he
      sailed round the world in a pea-shell boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was summer time, when the pea shells grew long and green in the garden.
      Little Lasse crept into the pea bed where the pea stalks rose high above
      his cap, and he picked seventeen large shells, the longest and straightest
      he could find.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Lasse thought, perhaps, that no one saw him; but that was foolish,
      for God sees everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the gardener came with his gun over his shoulder, and he heard
      something rustling in the pea bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think that must be a sparrow,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Ras! Ras!&rsquo; but no sparrows
      flew out, for Little Lasse had no wings, only two small legs. &lsquo;Wait! I
      will load my gun and shoot the sparrows,&rsquo; said the gardener.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Little Lasse was frightened, and crept out on to the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Forgive me, dear gardener!&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I wanted to get some fine boats.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I will this time,&rsquo; said the gardener. &lsquo;But another time Little
      Lasse must ask leave to go and look for boats in the pea bed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will,&rsquo; answered Lasse; and he went off to the shore. Then he opened the
      shells with a pin, split them carefully in two, and broke small little
      bits of sticks for the rowers&rsquo; seats. Then he took the peas which were in
      the shells and put them in the boats for cargo. Some of the shells got
      broken, some remained whole, and when all were ready Lasse had twelve
      boats. But they should not be boats, they should be large warships. He had
      three liners, three frigates, three brigs and three schooners. The largest
      liner was called Hercules, and the smallest schooner The Flea. Little
      Lasse put all the twelve into the water, and they floated as splendidly
      and as proudly as any great ships over the waves of the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the ships must sail round the world. The great island over there
      was Asia; that large stone Africa; the little island America; the small
      stones were Polynesia; and the shore from which the ships sailed out was
      Europe. The whole fleet set off and sailed far away to other parts of the
      world. The ships of the line steered a straight course to Asia, the
      frigates sailed to Africa, the brigs to America, and the schooners to
      Polynesia. But Little Lasse remained in Europe, and threw small stones out
      into the great sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, there was on the shore of Europe a real boat, father&rsquo;s own, a
      beautiful white-painted boat, and Little Lasse got into it. Father and
      mother had forbidden this, but Little Lasse forgot. He thought he should
      very much like to travel to some other part of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall row out a little way&mdash;only a very little way,&rsquo; he thought.
      The pea-shell boats had travelled so far that they only looked like little
      specks on the ocean. &lsquo;I shall seize Hercules on the coast of Asia,&rsquo; said
      Lasse, &lsquo;and then row home again to Europe.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook the rope that held the boat, and, strange to say, the rope became
      loose. Ditsch, ratsch, a man is a man, and so Little Lasse manned the
      boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now he would row&mdash;and he could row, for he had rowed so often on the
      step sat home, when the steps pretended to be a boat and father&rsquo;s big
      stick an oar. But when Little Lasse wanted to row there were no oars to be
      found in the boat. The oars were locked up in the boat-house, and Little
      Lasse had not noticed that the boat was empty. It is not so easy as one
      thinks to row to Asia without oars.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could Little Lasse do now? The boat was already some distance out on
      the sea, and the wind, which blew from land, was driving it still further
      out. Lasse was frightened and began to cry. But there was no one on the
      shore to hear him. Only a big crow perched alone in the birch tree; and
      the gardener&rsquo;s black cat sat under the birch tree, waiting to catch the
      crow. Neither of them troubled themselves in the least about Little Lasse,
      who was drifting out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ah! how sorry Little Lasse was now that he had been disobedient and got
      into the boat, when father and mother had so often forbidden him to do so!
      Now it was too late, he could not get back to land. Perhaps he would be
      lost out on the great sea. What should he do?
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had shouted until he was tired and no one heard him, he put his
      two little hands together and said, &lsquo;Good God, do not be angry with Little
      Lasse.&rsquo; And then he went to sleep. For although it was daylight, old Nukku
      Matti was sitting on the shores of the &lsquo;Land of Nod,&rsquo; and was fishing for
      little children with his long fishing rod. He heard the low words which
      Little Lasse said to God, and he immediately drew the boat to himself and
      laid Little Lasse to sleep on a bed of rose leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Nukku Matti said to one of the Dreams, &lsquo;Play with Little Lasse, so
      that he does not feel lonesome.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a little dream-boy, so little, so little, that he was less than
      Lasse himself; he had blue eyes and fair hair, a red cap with a silver
      band, and white coat with pearls on the collar. He came to Little Lasse
      and said, &lsquo;Would you like to sail round the world?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Lasse in his sleep, &lsquo;I should like to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, then,&rsquo; said the dream-boy, &lsquo;and let us sail in your pea-shell
      boats. You shall sail in Hercules and I shall sail in The Flea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they sailed away from the &lsquo;Land of Nod,&rsquo; and in a little while Hercules
      and The Flea were on the shores of Asia away at the other end of the
      world, where the Ice Sea flows through Behring Straits into the Pacific
      Ocean. A long way off in the winter mist they could see the explorer
      Nordenskiold with his ship Vega trying to find an opening between the ice.
      It was so cold, so cold; the great icebergs glittered strangely, and the
      huge whales now lived under the ice, for they could not make a hole
      through with their awkward heads. All around on the dreary shore there was
      snow and snow as far as the eye could see; little grey men in shaggy skins
      moved about, and drove in small sledges through the snow drifts, but the
      sledges were drawn by dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall we land here?&rsquo; asked the dream-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Little Lasse. &lsquo;I am so afraid that the whales would swallow us
      up, and the big dogs bite us. Let us sail instead to another part of the
      world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said the dream-boy with the red cap and the silver band; &lsquo;it
      is not far to America&rsquo;&mdash;and at the same moment they were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was shining and it was very warm. Tall palm trees grew in long
      rows on the shore and bore coconuts in their top branches. Men red as
      copper galloped over the immense green prairies and shot their arrows at
      the buffaloes, who turned against them with their sharp horns. An enormous
      cobra which had crept up the stem of a tall palm tree threw itself on to a
      little llama that was grazing at the foot. Knaps! it was all over the
      little llama.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall we land here?&rsquo; asked the dream-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Little Lasse. &lsquo;I am so afraid that the buffaloes will butt us,
      and the great serpent eat us up. Let us travel to another part of the
      world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said the dream-boy with the white coat, &lsquo;it is only a little
      way to Polynesia&rsquo;&mdash;and then they were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very warm there, as warm as in a hot bath in Finland. Costly spices
      grew on the shores: the pepper plant, the cinnamon tree, ginger, saffron;
      the coffee plant and the tea plant. Brown people with long ears and thick
      lips, and hideously painted faces, hunted a yellow-spotted tiger among the
      high bamboos on the shore, and the tiger turned on them and stuck its
      claws into one of the brown men. Then all the others took to flight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall we land here?&rsquo; asked the dream-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Little Lasse. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you see the tiger away there by the pepper
      plant? Let us travel to another part of the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can do so,&rsquo; said the dream-boy with the blue eyes. &lsquo;We are not far
      from Africa&rsquo;&mdash;and as he said that they were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      They anchored at the mouth of a great river where the shores were as green
      as the greenest velvet. A little distance from the river an immense desert
      stretched away. The air was yellow; the sun shone so hot, so hot as if it
      would burn the earth to ashes, and the people were as black as the
      blackest jet. They rode across the desert on tall camels; the lions roared
      with thirst, and the great crocodiles with their grey lizard heads and
      sharp white teeth gaped up out of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall we land here?&rsquo; asked the dream-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Little Lasse. &lsquo;The sun would burn us, and the lions and the
      crocodiles would eat us up. Let us travel to another part of the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can travel back to Europe,&rsquo; said the dream-boy with the fair hair. And
      with that they were there.
    </p>
    <p>
      They came to a shore where it was all so cool and familiar and friendly.
      There stood the tall birch tree with its drooping leaves; at the top sat
      the old crow, and at its foot crept the gardener&rsquo;s black cat. Not far away
      was a house which Little Lasse had seen before; near the house there was a
      garden, and in the garden a pea bed with long pea shells. An old gardener
      with a green coat walked about and wondered if the cucumbers were ripe.
      Fylax was barking on the steps, and when he saw Little Lasse he wagged his
      tail. Old Stina was milking the cows in the farmyard, and there was a very
      familiar lady in a check woollen shawl on her way to the bleaching green
      to see if the clothes were bleached. There was, too, a well-known
      gentleman in a yellow summer coat, with a long pipe in his mouth; he was
      going to see if the reapers had cut the rye. A boy and a girl were running
      on the shore and calling out, &lsquo;Little Lasse! Come home for
      bread-and-butter!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall we land here?&rsquo; asked the dream-boy, and he blinked his blue eyes
      roguishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come with me, and I shall ask mother to give you some bread-and-butter
      and a glass of milk,&rsquo; said Little Lasse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait a little,&rsquo; said the dream-boy. And now Little Lasse saw that the
      kitchen door was open, and from within there was heard a low, pleasant
      frizzling, like that which is heard when one whisks yellow batter with a
      wooden ladle into a hot frying-pan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps we should sail back to Polynesia now?&rsquo; said the happy dream-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; they are frying pancakes in Europe just now,&rsquo; said Little Lasse; and
      he wanted to jump ashore, but he could not. The dream-boy had tied him
      with a chain of flowers, so that he could not move. And now all the little
      dreams came about him, thousands and thousands of little children, and
      they made a ring around him and sang a little song:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          The world is very, very wide,
               Little Lasse, Lasse,
          And though you&rsquo;ve sailed beyond the tide,
          You can never tell how wide
          It is on the other side,
               Lasse, Little Lasse.
          You have found it cold and hot,
               Little Lasse, Lasse;
          But in no land is God not,
               Lasse, Little Lasse.
          Many men live there as here,
          But they all to God are dear,
               Little Lasse, Lasse.
          When His angel is your guide,
               Little Lasse, Lasse,
          Then no harm can e&rsquo;er betide,
          Even on the other side
               Where the wild beasts wander.
          But tell us now,
               Whene&rsquo;er you roam,
               Do you not find the best is home
          Of all the lands you&rsquo;ve looked upon,
               Lasse, Little Lasse?
</pre>
    <p>
      When the dreams had sung their song they skipped away, and Nukku Matti
      carried Lasse back to the boat. He lay there for a long time quite still,
      and he still heard the frying-pan frizzling at home of the fire, the
      frizzling was very plain, Little Lasse heard it quite near him; and so he
      woke up and rubbed his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There he lay in the boat, where he had fallen asleep. The wind had turned,
      and the boat had drifted out with one wind and drifted in with another
      while Little Lasse slept, and what Lasse thought was frizzling in a
      frying-pan was the low murmur of the waves as they washed against the
      stones on the shore. But he was not altogether wrong, for the clear blue
      sea is like a great pan in which God&rsquo;s sun all day makes cakes for good
      children.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Lasse rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and looked around him.
      Everything was the same as before; the crow in the birch tree, the cat on
      the grass, and the pea-shell fleet on the shore. Some of the ships had
      foundered, and some had drifted back to land. Hercules had come back with
      its cargo from Asia, The Flea had arrived from Polynesia, and the other
      parts of the world were just where they were before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Lasse did not know what to think. He had so often been in that
      grotto in the &lsquo;Land of Nod&rsquo; and did not know what tricks dreams can play.
      But Little Lasse did not trouble his head with such things; he gathered
      together his boats and walked up the shore back to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      His brother and sister ran to meet him, and called out from the distance,
      &lsquo;Where have you been so long, Lasse? Come home and get some
      bread-and-butter.&rsquo; The kitchen door stood open, and inside was heard a
      strange frizzling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gardener was near the gate, watering the dill and parsley, the carrots
      and parsnips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;where has Little Lasse been so long?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Lasse straightened himself up stiff, and answered: &lsquo;I have sailed
      round the world in a pea-shell boat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said the gardener.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has forgotten Dreamland. But you have not forgotten it; you know that
      it exists. You know the beautiful grotto and the bright silver walls whose
      lustre never fades, the sparkling diamonds which never grow dim, the music
      which never ceases its low, soft murmur through the sweet evening
      twilight. The airy fairy fancies of happy Dreamland never grow old; they,
      like the glorious stars above us, are always young. Perhaps you have
      caught a glimpse of their ethereal wings as they flew around your pillow.
      Perhaps you have met the same dream-boy with the blue eyes and the fair
      hair, the one who wore the red cap with the silver band and the white coat
      with pearls on the collar. Perhaps he has taken you to see all the
      countries of the world and the peoples, the cold waste lands and the
      burning deserts, the many coloured men and the wild creatures in the sea
      and in the woods, so that you may earn many things, but come gladly home
      again. Yes, who knows? Perhaps you also have sailed round the wide world
      once in a pea-shell boat.

    <h2>
      &lsquo;Moti&rsquo; 
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once upon a time there was a youth called Moti, who was very big and
      strong, but the clumsiest creature you can imagine. So clumsy was he that
      he was always putting his great feet into the bowls of sweet milk or curds
      which his mother set out on the floor to cool, always smashing, upsetting,
      breaking, until at last his father said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, Moti, are fifty silver pieces which are the savings of years; take
      them and go and make your living or your fortune if you can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Moti started off one early spring morning with his thick staff over
      his shoulder, singing gaily to himself as he walked along.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one way and another he got along very well until a hot evening when he
      came to a certain city where he entered the travellers&rsquo; &lsquo;serai&rsquo; or inn to
      pass the night. Now a serai, you must know, is generally just a large
      square enclosed by a high wall with an open colonnade along the inside all
      round to accommodate both men and beasts, and with perhaps a few rooms in
      towers at the corners for those who are too rich or too proud to care
      about sleeping by their own camels and horses. Moti, of course, was a
      country lad and had lived with cattle all his life, and he wasn&rsquo;t rich and
      he wasn&rsquo;t proud, so he just borrowed a bed from the innkeeper, set it down
      beside an old buffalo who reminded him of home, and in five minutes was
      fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the night he woke, feeling that he had been disturbed,
      and putting his hand under his pillow found to his horror that his bag of
      money had been stolen. He jumped up quietly and began to prowl around to
      see whether anyone seemed to be awake, but, though he managed to arouse a
      few men and beasts by falling over them, he walked in the shadow of the
      archways round the whole serai without coming across a likely thief. He
      was just about to give it up when he overheard two men whispering, and one
      laughed softly, and peering behind a pillar, he saw two Afghan
      horsedealers counting out his bag of money! Then Moti went back to bed!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning Moti followed the two Afghans outside the city to the
      horsemarket in which they horses were offered for sale. Choosing the
      best-looking horse amongst them he went up to it and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this horse for sale? may I try it?&rsquo; and, the merchants assenting, he
      scrambled up on its back, dug in his heels, and off they flew. Now Moti
      had never been on a horse in his life, and had so much ado to hold on with
      both hands as well as with both legs that the animal went just where it
      liked, and very soon broke into a break-neck gallop and made straight back
      to the serai where it had spent the last few nights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This will do very well,&rsquo; thought Moti as they whirled in at the entrance.
      As soon as the horse had arrived at its table it stopped of its own accord
      and Moti immediately rolled off; but he jumped up at once, tied the beast
      up, and called for some breakfast. Presently the Afghans appeared, out of
      breath and furious, and claimed the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; cried Moti, with his mouth full of rice, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s my
      horse; I paid you fifty pieces of silver for it&mdash;quite a bargain, I&rsquo;m
      sure!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense! it is our horse,&rsquo; answered one of the Afghans beginning to
      untie the bridle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave off,&rsquo; shouted Moti, seizing his staff; &lsquo;if you don&rsquo;t let my horse
      alone I&rsquo;ll crack your skulls! you thieves! I know you! Last night you took
      my money, so to-day I took your horse; that&rsquo;s fair enough!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the Afghans began to look a little uncomfortable, but Moti seemed so
      determined to keep the horse that they resolved to appeal to the law, so
      they went off and laid a complaint before the king that Moti had stolen
      one of their horses and would not give it up nor pay for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a soldier came to summon Moti to the king; and, when he arrived
      and made his obeisance, the king began to question him as to why he had
      galloped off with the horse in this fashion. But Moti declared that he had
      got the animal in exchange for fifty pieces of silver, whilst the horse
      merchants vowed that the money they had on them was what they had received
      for the sale of other horses; and in one way and another the dispute got
      so confusing that the king (who really thought that Moti had stolen the
      horse) said at last, &lsquo;Well, I tell you what I will do. I will lock
      something into this box before me, and if he guesses what it is, the horse
      is his, and if he doesn&rsquo;t then it is yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To this Moti agreed, and the king arose and went out alone by a little
      door at the back of the Court, and presently came back clasping something
      closely wrapped up in a cloth under his robe, slipped it into the little
      box, locked the box, and set it up where all might see.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the king to Moti, &lsquo;guess!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that when the king had opened the door behind him, Moti
      noticed that there was a garden outside: without waiting for the king&rsquo;s
      return he began to think what could be got out of the garden small enough
      to be shut in the box. &lsquo;Is it likely to be a fruit or a flower? No, not a
      flower this time, for he clasped it too tight. Then it must be a fruit or
      a stone. Yet not a stone, because he wouldn&rsquo;t wrap a dirty stone in his
      nice clean cloth. Then it is a fruit! And a fruit without much scent, or
      else he would be afraid that I might smell it. Now what fruit without much
      scent is in season just now? When I know that I shall have guessed the
      riddle!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As has been said before, Moti was a country lad, and was accustomed to
      work in his father&rsquo;s garden. He knew all the common fruits, so he thought
      he ought to be able to guess right; but so as not to let it seem too easy,
      he gazed up at the ceiling with a puzzled expression, and looked down at
      the floor with an air or wisdom and his fingers pressed against his
      forehead, and then he said, slowly, with his eyes on the king,&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is freshly plucked! It is round and it is red! It is a pomegranate!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the king knew nothing about fruits except that they were good to eat;
      and, as for seasons, he asked for whatever fruit he wanted whenever he
      wanted it, and saw that he got it; so to him Moti&rsquo;s guess was like a
      miracle, and clear proof not only of his wisdom but of his innocence, for
      it was a pomegranate that he had put into the box. Of course when the king
      marvelled and praised Moti&rsquo;s wisdom, everybody else did so too; and,
      whilst the Afghans went off crestfallen, Moti took the horse and entered
      the king&rsquo;s service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon after this, Moti, who continued to live in the serai, came back
      one wet and stormy evening to find that his precious horse had strayed.
      Nothing remained of him but a broken halter cord, and no one knew what had
      become of him. After inquiring of everyone who was likely to know, Moti
      seized the cord and his big staff and sallied out to look for him. Away
      and away he tramped out of the city and into the neighbouring forest,
      tracking hoof-marks in the mud. Presently it grew late, but still Moti
      wandered on until suddenly in the gathering darkness he came right upon a
      tiger who was contentedly eating his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You thief!&rsquo; shrieked Moti, and ran up and, just as the tiger, in
      astonishment, dropped a bone&mdash;whack! came Moti&rsquo;s staff on his head
      with such good will that the beast was half stunned and could hardly
      breathe or see. Then Moti continued to shower upon him blows and abuse
      until the poor tiger could hardly stand, whereupon his tormentor tied the
      end of the broken halter round his neck and dragged him back to the serai.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you had my horse,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I will at least have you, that&rsquo;s fair
      enough!&rsquo; And he tied him up securely by the head and heels, much as he
      used to tie the horse; then, the night being far gone, he flung himself
      beside him and slept soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      You cannot imagine anything like the fright of the people in the serai,
      when they woke up and found a tiger&mdash;very battered but still a tiger&mdash;securely
      tethered amongst themselves and their beasts! Men gathered in groups
      talking and exclaiming, and finding fault with the innkeeper for allowing
      such a dangerous beast into the serai, and all the while the innkeeper was
      just as troubled as the rest, and none dared go near the place where the
      tiger stood blinking miserably on everyone, and where Moti lay stretched
      out snoring like thunder.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last news reached the king that Moti had exchanged his horse for a live
      tiger; and the monarch himself came down, half disbelieving the tale, to
      see if it were really true. Someone at last awaked Moti with the news that
      his royal master was come; and he arose yawning, and was soon delightedly
      explaining and showing off his new possession. The king, however, did not
      share his pleasure at all, but called up a soldier to shoot the tiger,
      much to the relief of all the inmates of the serai except Moti. If the
      king, however, was before convinced that Moti was one of the wisest of
      men, he was now still more convinced that he was the bravest, and he
      increased his pay a hundredfold, so that our hero thought that he was the
      luckiest of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      A week or two after this incident the king sent for Moti, who on arrival
      found his master in despair. A neighbouring monarch, he explained, who had
      many more soldiers than he, had declared war against him, and he was at
      his wits&rsquo; end, for he had neither money to buy him off nor soldiers enough
      to fight him&mdash;what was he to do?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If that is all, don&rsquo;t you trouble,&rsquo; said Moti. &lsquo;Turn out your men, and
      I&rsquo;ll go with them, and we&rsquo;ll soon bring this robber to reason.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The king began to revive at these hopeful words, and took Moti off to his
      stable where he bade him choose for himself any horse he liked. There were
      plenty of fine horses in the stalls, but to the king&rsquo;s astonishment Moti
      chose a poor little rat of a pony that was used to carry grass and water
      for the rest of the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why do you choose that beast?&rsquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you see, your majesty,&rsquo; replied Moti, &lsquo;there are so many chances
      that I may fall off, and if I choose one of your fine big horses I shall
      have so far to fall that I shall probably break my leg or my arm, if not
      my neck, but if I fall off this little beast I can&rsquo;t hurt myself much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A very comical sight was Moti when he rode out to the war. The only weapon
      he carried was his staff, and to help him to keep his balance on horseback
      he had tied to each of his ankles a big stone that nearly touched the
      ground as he sat astride the little pony. The rest of the king&rsquo;s cavalry
      were not very numerous, but they pranced along in armour on fine horses.
      Behind them came a great rabble of men on foot armed with all sorts of
      weapons, and last of all was the king with his attendants, very nervous
      and ill at ease. So the army started.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not very far to go, but Moti&rsquo;s little pony, weighted with a heavy
      man and two big rocks, soon began to lag behind the cavalry, and would
      have lagged behind the infantry too, only they were not very anxious to be
      too early in the fight, and hung back so as to give Moti plenty of time.
      The young man jogged along more and more slowly for some time, until at
      last, getting impatient at the slowness of the pony, he gave him such a
      tremendous thwack with his staff that the pony completely lost his temper
      and bolted. First one stone became untied and rolled away in a cloud of
      dust to one side of the road, whilst Moti nearly rolled off too, but
      clasped his steed valiantly by its ragged mane, and, dropping his staff,
      held on for dear life. Then, fortunately the other rock broke away from
      his other leg and rolled thunderously down a neighbouring ravine.
      Meanwhile the advanced cavalry had barely time to draw to one side when
      Moti came dashing by, yelling bloodthirsty threats to his pony:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wait till I get hold of you! I&rsquo;ll skin you alive! I&rsquo;ll wring your
      neck! I&rsquo;ll break every bone in your body!&rsquo; The cavalry thought that this
      dreadful language was meant for the enemy, and were filled with admiration
      of his courage. Many of their horses too were quite upset by this
      whirlwind that galloped howling through their midst, and in a few minutes,
      after a little plunging and rearing and kicking, the whole troop were
      following on Moti&rsquo;s heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far in advance, Moti continued his wild career. Presently in his course he
      came to a great field of castor-oil plants, ten or twelve feet high, big
      and bushy, but quite green and soft. Hoping to escape from the back of his
      fiery steed Moti grasped one in passing, but its roots gave way, and he
      dashed on, with the whole plant looking like a young tree flourishing in
      his grip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The enemy were in battle array, advancing over the plain, their king with
      them confident and cheerful, when suddenly from the front came a desperate
      rider at a furious gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sire!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;save yourself! the enemy are coming!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, sire!&rsquo; panted the messenger, &lsquo;fly at once, there is no time to lose.
      Foremost of the enemy rides a mad giant at a furious gallop. He flourishes
      a tree for a club and is wild with anger, for as he goes he cries, &ldquo;You
      wait till I get hold of you! I&rsquo;ll skin you alive! I&rsquo;ll wring your neck!
      I&rsquo;ll break every bone in your body!&rdquo; Others ride behind, and you will do
      well to retire before this whirlwind of destruction comes upon you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then out of a cloud of dust in the distance the king saw Moti
      approaching at a hard gallop, looking indeed like a giant compared with
      the little beast he rode, whirling his castor-oil plant, which in the
      distance might have been an oak tree, and the sound of his revilings and
      shoutings came down upon the breeze! Behind him the dust cloud moved to
      the sound of the thunder of hoofs, whilst here and there flashed the
      glitter of steel. The sight and the sound struck terror into the king,
      and, turning his horse, he fled at top speed, thinking that a regiment of
      yelling giants was upon him; and all his force followed him as fast as
      they might go. One fat officer alone could not keep up on foot with that
      mad rush, and as Moti came galloping up he flung himself on the ground in
      abject fear. This was too much for Moti&rsquo;s excited pony, who shied so
      suddenly that Moti went flying over his head like a sky rocket, and
      alighted right on the top of his fat foe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quickly regaining his feet Moti began to swing his plant round his head
      and to shout:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are your men? Bring them up and I&rsquo;ll kill them. My regiments! Come
      on, the whole lot of you! Where&rsquo;s your king? Bring him to me. Here are all
      my fine fellows coming up and we&rsquo;ll each pull up a tree by the roots and
      lay you all flat and your houses and towns and everything else! Come on!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But the poor fat officer could do nothing but squat on his knees with his
      hands together, gasping. At last, when he got his breath, Moti sent him
      off to bring his king, and to tell him that if he was reasonable his life
      should be spared. Off the poor man went, and by the time the troops of
      Moti&rsquo;s side had come up and arranged themselves to look as formidable as
      possible, he returned with his king. The latter was very humble and
      apologetic, and promised never to make war any more, to pay a large sum of
      money, and altogether do whatever his conqueror wished.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the armies on both sides went rejoicing home, and this was really the
      making of the fortune of clumsy Moti, who lived long and contrived always
      to be looked up to as a fountain of wisdom, valour, and discretion by all
      except his relations, who could never understand what he had done to be
      considered so much wiser than anyone else.

    <h2>
      The Enchanted Deer
    </h2>
    <p>
      A young man was out walking one day in Erin, leading a stout cart-horse by
      the bridle. He was thinking of his mother and how poor they were since his
      father, who was a fisherman, had been drowned at sea, and wondering what
      he should do to earn a living for both of them. Suddenly a hand was laid
      on his shoulder, and a voice said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you sell me your horse, son of the fisherman?&rsquo; and looking up he
      beheld a man standing in the road with a gun in his hand, a falcon on his
      shoulder, and a dog by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What will you give me for my horse?&rsquo; asked the youth. &lsquo;Will you give me
      your gun, and your dog, and your falcon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will give them,&rsquo; answered the man, and he took the horse, and the youth
      took the gun and the dog and the falcon, and went home with them. But when
      his mother heard what he had done she was very angry, and beat him with a
      stick which she had in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That will teach you to sell my property,&rsquo; said she, when her arm was
      quite tired, but Ian her son answered her nothing, and went off to his
      bed, for he was very sore.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night he rose softly, and left the house carrying the gun with him.
      &lsquo;I will not stay here to be beaten,&rsquo; thought he, and he walked and he
      walked and he walked, till it was day again, and he was hungry and looked
      about him to see if he could get anything to eat. Not very far off was a
      farm-house, so he went there, and knocked at the door, and the farmer and
      his wife begged him to come in, and share their breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, you have a gun,&rsquo; said the farmer as the young man placed it in a
      corner. &lsquo;That is well, for a deer comes every evening to eat my corn, and
      I cannot catch it. It is fortune that has sent you to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will gladly remain and shoot the deer for you,&rsquo; replied the youth, and
      that night he hid himself and watched till the deer came to the cornfield;
      then he lifted his gun to his shoulder and was just going to pull the
      trigger, when, behold! instead of a deer, a woman with long black hair was
      standing there. At this sight his gun almost dropped from his hand in
      surprise, but as he looked, there was the deer eating the corn again. And
      thrice this happened, till the deer ran away over the moor, and the young
      man after her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they went, on and on and one, till they reached a cottage which was
      thatched with heather. With a bound the deer sprang on the roof, and lay
      down where none could see her, but as she did so she called out, &lsquo;Go in,
      fisher&rsquo;s son, and eat and drink while you may.&rsquo; So he entered and found
      food and wine on the table, but no man, for the house belonged to some
      robbers, who were still away at their wicked business.
    </p>
    <p>
      After Ian, the fisher&rsquo;s son, had eaten all he wanted, he hid himself
      behind a great cask, and very soon he heard a noise, as of men coming
      through the heather, and the small twigs snapping under their feet. From
      his dark corner he could see into the room, and he counted four and twenty
      of them, all big, cross-looking men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some one has been eating our dinner,&rsquo; cried they, &lsquo;and there was hardly
      enough for ourselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the man who is lying under the cask,&rsquo; answered the leader. &lsquo;Go and
      kill him, and then come and eat your food and sleep, for we must be off
      betimes in the morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So four of them killed the fisher&rsquo;s son and left him, and then went to
      bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      By sunrise they were all out of the house, for they had far to go. And
      when they had disappeared the deer came off the roof, to where the dead
      man lay, and she shook her head over him, and wax fell from her ear, and
      he jumped up as well as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trust me and eat as you did before, and no harm shall happen to you,&rsquo; 
      said she. So Ian ate and drank, and fell sound asleep under the cask. In
      the evening the robbers arrived very tired, and crosser than they had been
      yesterday, for their luck had turned and they had brought back scarcely
      anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Someone has eaten our dinner again,&rsquo; cried they.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the man under the barrel,&rsquo; answered the captain. &lsquo;Let four of you
      go and kill him, but first slay the other four who pretended to kill him
      last night and didn&rsquo;t because he is still alive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Ian was killed a second time, and after the rest of the robbers had
      eaten, they lay down and slept till morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner were their faces touched with the sun&rsquo;s rays than they were up
      and off. Then the deer entered and dropped the healing wax on the dead
      man, and he was as well as ever. By this time he did not mind what befell
      him, so sure was he that the deer would take care of him, and in the
      evening that which had happened before happened again&mdash;the four
      robbers were put to death and the fisher&rsquo;s son also, but because there was
      no food left for them to eat, they were nearly mad with rage, and began to
      quarrel. From quarrelling they went on to fighting, and fought so hard
      that by and bye they were all stretched dead on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the deer entered, and the fisher&rsquo;s son was restored to life, and
      bidding him follow her, she ran on to a little white cottage where dwelt
      an old woman and her son, who was thin and dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here I must leave you,&rsquo; said the deer, &lsquo;but to-morrow meet me at midday
      in the church that is yonder.&rsquo; And jumping across the stream, she vanished
      into a wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day he set out for the church, but the old woman of the cottage had
      gone before him, and had stuck an enchanted stick called &lsquo;the spike of
      hurt&rsquo; in a crack of the door, so that he would brush against it as he
      stepped across the threshold. Suddenly he felt so sleepy that he could not
      stand up, and throwing himself on the ground he sank into a deep slumber,
      not knowing that the dark lad was watching him. Nothing could waken him,
      not even the sound of sweetest music, nor the touch of a lady who bent
      over him. A sad look came on her face, as she saw it was no use, and at
      last she gave it up, and lifting his arm, wrote her name across the side&mdash;&lsquo;the
      daughter of the king of the town under the waves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will come to-morrow,&rsquo; she whispered, though he could not hear her, and
      she went sorrowfully away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he awoke, and the dark lad told him what had befallen him, and he was
      very grieved. But the dark lad did not tell him of the name that was
      written underneath his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the following morning the fisher&rsquo;s son again went to the church,
      determined that he would not go to sleep, whatever happened. But in his
      hurry to enter he touched with his hand the spike of hurt, and sank down
      where he stood, wrapped in slumber. A second time the air was filled with
      music, and the lady came in, stepping softly, but though she laid his head
      on her knee, and combed his hair with a golden comb, his eyes opened not.
      Then she burst into tears, and placing a beautifully wrought box in his
      pocket she went her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day the same thing befell the fisher&rsquo;s son, and this time the
      lady wept more bitterly than before, for she said it was the last chance,
      and she would never be allowed to come any more, for home she must go.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the lady had departed the fisher&rsquo;s son awoke, and the dark lad
      told him of her visit, and how he would never see her as long as he lived.
      At this the fisher&rsquo;s son felt the cold creeping up to his heart, yet he
      knew the fault had not been his that sleep had overtaken him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will search the whole world through till I find her,&rsquo; cried he, and the
      dark lad laughed as he heard him. But the fisher&rsquo;s son took no heed, and
      off he went, following the sun day after day, till his shoes were in holes
      and his feet were sore from the journey. Nought did he see but the birds
      that made their nests in the trees, not so much as a goat or a rabbit. On
      and on and on he went, till suddenly he came upon a little house, with a
      woman standing outside it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All hail, fisher&rsquo;s son!&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;I know what you are seeking; enter in
      and rest and eat, and to-morrow I will give you what help I can, and send
      you on your way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gladly did Ian the fisher&rsquo;s son accept her offer, and all that day he
      rested, and the woman gave him ointment to put on his feet, which healed
      his sores. At daybreak he got up, ready to be gone, and the woman bade him
      farewell, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have a sister who dwells on the road which you must travel. It is a
      long road, and it would take you a year and a day to reach it, but put on
      these old brown shoes with holes all over them, and you will be there
      before you know it. Then shake them off, and turn their toes to the known,
      and their heels to the unknown, and they will come home of themselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fisher&rsquo;s son did as the woman told him, and everything happened just
      as she had said. But at parting the second sister said to him, as she gave
      him another pair of shoes:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go to my third sister, for she has a son who is keeper of the birds of
      the air, and sends them to sleep when night comes. He is very wise, and
      perhaps he can help you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the young man thanked her, and went to the third sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third sister was very kind, but had no counsel to give him, so he ate
      and drank and waited till her son came home, after he had sent all the
      birds to sleep. He thought a long while after his mother had told him the
      young man&rsquo;s story, and at last he said that he was hungry, and the cow
      must be killed, as he wanted some supper. So the cow was killed and the
      meat cooked, and a bag made of its red skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now get into the bag,&rsquo; bade the son, and the young man got in and took
      his gun with him, but the dog and the falcon he left outside. The keeper
      of the birds drew the string at the top of the bag, and left it to finish
      his supper, when in flew an eagle through the open door, and picked the
      bag up in her claws and carried it through the air to an island. There was
      nothing to eat on the island, and the fisher&rsquo;s son thought he would die of
      food, when he remembered the box that the lady had put in his pocket. He
      opened the lid, and three tiny little birds flew out, and flapping their
      wings they asked,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good master, is there anything we can do for thee?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bear me to the kingdom of the king under the waves,&rsquo; he answered, and one
      little bird flew on to his head, and the others perched on each of his
      shoulders, and he shut his eyes, and in a moment there he was in the
      country under the sea. Then the birds flew away, and the young man looked
      about him, his heart beating fast at the thought that here dwelt the lady
      whom he had sought all the world over.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked on through the streets, and presently he reached the house of a
      weaver who was standing at his door, resting from his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a stranger here, that is plain,&rsquo; said the weaver, &lsquo;but come in,
      and I will give you food and drink.&rsquo; And the young man was glad, for he
      knew not where to go, and they sat and talked till it grew late.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay with me, I pray, for I love company and am lonely,&rsquo; observed the
      weaver at last, and he pointed to a bed in a corner, where the fisher&rsquo;s
      son threw himself, and slept till dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is to be a horse-race in the town to-day,&rsquo; remarked the weaver,
      &lsquo;and the winner is to have the king&rsquo;s daughter to wife.&rsquo; The young man
      trembled with excitement at the news, and his voice shook as he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That will be a prize indeed, I should like to see the race.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that is quite easy&mdash;anyone can go,&rsquo; replied the weaver. &lsquo;I would
      take you myself, but I have promised to weave this cloth for the king.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is a pity,&rsquo; returned the young man politely, but in his heart he
      rejoiced, for he wished to be alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the house, he entered a grove of trees which stood behind, and
      took the box from his pocket. He raised the lid, and out flew the three
      little birds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good master, what shall we do for thee?&rsquo; asked they, and he answered,
      &lsquo;Bring me the finest horse that ever was seen, and the grandest dress, and
      glass shoes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are here, master,&rsquo; said the birds, and so they were, and never had
      the young man seen anything so splendid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mounting the horse he rode into the ground where the horses were
      assembling for the great race, and took his place among them. Many good
      beasts were there which had won many races, but the horse of the fisher&rsquo;s
      son left them all behind, and he was first at the winning post. The king&rsquo;s
      daughter waited for him in vain to claim his prize, for he went back to
      the wood, and got off his horse, and put on his old clothes, and bade the
      box place some gold in his pockets. After that he went back to the
      weaver&rsquo;s house, and told him that the gold had been given him by the man
      who had won the race, and that the weaver might have it for his kindness
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now as nobody had appeared to demand the hand of the princess, the king
      ordered another race to be run, and the fisher&rsquo;s son rode into the field
      still more splendidly dressed than he was before, and easily distanced
      everybody else. But again he left the prize unclaimed, and so it happened
      on the third day, when it seemed as if all the people in the kingdom were
      gathered to see the race, for they were filled with curiosity to know who
      the winner could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he will not come of his own free will, he must be brought,&rsquo; said the
      king, and the messengers who had seen the face of the victor were sent to
      seek him in every street of the town. This took many days, and when at
      last they found the young man in the weaver&rsquo;s cottage, he was so dirty and
      ugly and had such a strange appearance, that they declared he could not be
      the winner they had been searching for, but a wicked robber who had
      murdered ever so many people, but had always managed to escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it must be the robber,&rsquo; said the king, when the fisher&rsquo;s son was led
      into his presence; &lsquo;build a gallows at once and hang him in the sight of
      all my subjects, that they may behold him suffer the punishment of his
      crimes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So the gallows was built upon a high platform, and the fisher&rsquo;s son
      mounted the steps up to it, and turned at the top to make the speech that
      was expected from every doomed man, innocent or guilt. As he spoke he
      happened to raise his arm, and the king&rsquo;s daughter, who was there at her
      father&rsquo;s side, saw the name which she had written under it. With a shriek
      she sprang from her seat, and the eyes of the spectators were turned
      towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop! stop!&rsquo; she cried, hardly knowing what she said. &lsquo;If that man is
      hanged there is not a soul in the kingdom but shall die also.&rsquo; And running
      up to where the fisher&rsquo;s son was standing, she took him by the hand,
      saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Father, this is no robber or murderer, but the victor in the three races,
      and he loosed the spells that were laid upon me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, without waiting for a reply, she conducted him into the palace, and
      he bathed in a marble bath, and all the dirt that the fairies had put upon
      him disappeared like magic, and when he had dressed himself in the fine
      garments the princess had sent to him, he looked a match for any king&rsquo;s
      daughter in Erin. He went down into the great hall where she was awaiting
      him, and they had much to tell each other but little time to tell it in,
      for the king her father, and the princes who were visiting him, and all
      the people of the kingdom were still in their places expecting her return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did you find me out?&rsquo; she whispered as they went down the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The birds in the box told me,&rsquo; answered he, but he could say no more, as
      they stepped out into the open space that was crowded with people. There
      the princes stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O kings!&rsquo; she said, turning towards them, &lsquo;if one of you were killed
      to-day, the rest would fly; but this man put his trust in me, and had his
      head cut off three times. Because he has done this, I will marry him
      rather than one of you, who have come hither to wed me, for many kings
      here sought to free me from the spells, but none could do it save Ian the
      fisher&rsquo;s son.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      A Fish Story
    </h2>
    <p>
      Perhaps you think that fishes were always fishes, and never lived anywhere
      except in the water, but if you went to Australia and talked to the black
      people in the sandy desert in the centre of the country, you would learn
      something quite different. They would tell you that long, long ago you
      would have met fishes on the land, wandering from place to place, and
      hunting all sorts of animals, and if you consider how fishes are made, you
      will understand how difficult this must have been and how clever they were
      to do it. Indeed, so clever were they that they might have been hunting
      still if a terrible thing had not happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day the whole fish tribe came back very tired from a hunting
      expedition, and looked about for a nice, cool spot in which to pitch their
      camp. It was very hot, and they thought that they could not find a more
      comfortable place than under the branches of a large tree which grew by
      the bank of a river. So they made their fire to cook some food, right on
      the edge of a steep bank, which had a deep pool of water lying beneath it
      at the bottom. While the food was cooking they all stretched themselves
      lazily out under the tree, and were just dropping off to sleep when a big
      black cloud which they had never noticed spread over the sun, and heavy
      drops of rain began to fall, so that the fire was almost put out, and
      that, you know, is a very serious thing in savage countries where they
      have no matches, for it is very hard to light it again. To make matters
      worse, an icy wind began to blow, and the poor fishes were chilled right
      through their bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This will never do,&rsquo; said Thuggai, the oldest of the fish tribe. &lsquo;We
      shall die of cold unless we can light the fire again,&rsquo; and he bade his
      sons rub two sticks together in the hope of kindling a flame, but though
      they rubbed till they were tired, not a spark could they produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me try,&rsquo; cried Biernuga, the bony fish, but he had no better luck,
      and no more had Kumbal, the bream, nor any of the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is no use,&rsquo; exclaimed Thuggai, at last. &lsquo;The wood is too wet. We must
      just sit and wait till the sun comes out again and dries it.&rsquo; Then a very
      little fish indeed, not more than four inches long and the youngest of the
      tribe, bowed himself before Thuggai, saying, &lsquo;Ask my father, Guddhu the
      cod, to light the fire. He is skilled in magic more than most fishes.&rsquo; So
      Thuggai asked him, and Guddhu stripped some pieces of bark off a tree, and
      placed them on top of the smouldering ashes. Then he knelt by the side of
      the fire and blew at it for a long while, till slowly the feeble red glow
      became a little stronger and the edges of the bark showed signs of curling
      up. When the rest of the tribe saw this they pressed close, keeping their
      backs towards the piercing wind, but Guddhu told them they must go to the
      other side, as he wanted the wind to fan his fire. By and by the spark
      grew into a flame, and a merry crackling was heard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More wood,&rsquo; cried Guddhi, and they all ran and gathered wood and heaped
      it on the flames, which leaped and roared and sputtered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall soon be warm now,&rsquo; said the people one to another. &lsquo;Truly Guddhu
      is great&rsquo;; and they crowded round again, closer and closer. Suddenly, with
      a shriek, a blast of wind swept down from the hills and blew the fire out
      towards them. They sprang back hurriedly, quite forgetting where they
      stood, and all fell down the bank, each tumbling over the other, till they
      rolled into the pool that lay below. Oh, how cold it was in that dark
      water on which the sun never shone! Then in an instant they felt warm
      again, for the fire, driven by the strong wind, had followed them right
      down to the bottom of the pool, where it burned as brightly as ever. And
      the fishes gathered round it as they had done on the top of the cliff, and
      found the flames as hot as before, and that fire never went out, like
      those upon land, but kept burning for ever. So now you know why, if you
      dive deep down below the cold surface of the water on a frosty day, you
      will find it comfortable and pleasant underneath, and be quite sorry that
      you cannot stay there.

    <h2>
      The Wonderful Tune.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Maurice Connor was the king, and that&rsquo;s no small word, of all the pipers
      in Munster. He could play jig and reel without end, and Ollistrum&rsquo;s March,
      and the Eagle&rsquo;s Whistle, and the Hen&rsquo;s Concert, and odd tunes of every
      sort and kind. But he knew one far more surprising than the rest, which
      had in it the power to set everything dead or alive dancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      In what way he learned it is beyond my knowledge for he was mighty
      cautious about telling how he came by so wonderful a tune. At the very
      first note of that tune the shoes began shaking upon the feet of all how
      heard it&mdash;old or young, it mattered not&mdash;just as if the shoes
      had the ague; then the feet began going, going, going from under them, and
      at last up and away with them, dancing like mad, whisking here, there, and
      everywhere, like a straw in a storm&mdash;there was no halting while the
      music lasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a fair, nor a wedding, nor a feast in the seven parishes round, was
      counted worth the speaking of without &lsquo;blind Maurice and his pipes.&rsquo; His
      mother, poor woman, used to lead him about from one place to another just
      like a dog.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down through Iveragh, Maurice Connor and his mother were taking their
      rounds. Beyond all other places Iveragh is the place for stormy coasts and
      steep mountains, as proper a spot it is as any in Ireland to get yourself
      drowned, or your neck broken on the land, should you prefer that. But,
      notwithstanding, in Ballinskellig Bay there is a neat bit of ground, well
      fitted for diversion, and down from it, towards the water, is a clean
      smooth piece of strand, the dead image of a calm summer&rsquo;s sea on a
      moonlight night, with just the curl of the small waves upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is was that Maurice&rsquo;s music had brought from all parts a great
      gathering of the young men and the young women; for &lsquo;twas not every day
      the strand of Trafraska was stirred up by the voice of a bagpipe. The
      dance began; and as pretty a dance it was as ever was danced. &lsquo;Brave
      music,&rsquo; said everybody, &lsquo;and well done,&rsquo; when Maurice stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More power to your elbow, Maurice, and a fair wind in the bellows,&rsquo; cried
      Paddy Dorman, a hump-backed dancing master, who was there to keep order.
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a pity,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;if we&rsquo;d let the piper run dry after such music;
      &lsquo;twould be a disgrace to Iveragh, that didn&rsquo;t come on it since the week of
      the three Sundays.&rsquo; So, as well became him, for he was always a decent
      man, says he, &lsquo;Did you drink, piper?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will, sir,&rsquo; said Maurice, answering the question on the safe side, for
      you never yet knew piper or schoolmaster who refused his drink.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What will you drink, Maurice?&rsquo; says Paddy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m no ways particular,&rsquo; says Maurice; &lsquo;I drink anything, barring raw
      water; but if it&rsquo;s all the same to you, Mister Dorman, may be you wouldn&rsquo;t
      lend me the loan of a glass of whisky.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve no glass, Maurice,&rsquo; said Paddy; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve only the bottle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let that be no hindrance,&rsquo; answered Maurice; &lsquo;my mouth just holds a glass
      to the drop; often I&rsquo;ve tried it sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So Paddy Dorman trusted him with the bottle&mdash;more fool was he; and,
      to his cost, he found that though Maurice&rsquo;s mouth might not hold more than
      the glass at one time, yet, owing to the hole in his throat, it took many
      a filling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was no bad whisky neither,&rsquo; says Maurice, handing back the empty
      bottle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the holy frost, then!&rsquo; says Paddy, &lsquo;&rsquo;tis but cold comfort there&rsquo;s in
      that bottle now; and &lsquo;tis your word we must take for the strength of the
      whisky, for you&rsquo;ve left us no sample to judge by&rsquo;; and to be sure Maurice
      had not.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now I need not tell any gentleman or lady that if he or she was to drink
      an honest bottle of whisky at one pull, it is not at all the same thing as
      drinking a bottle of water; and in the whole course of my life I never
      knew more than five men who could do so without being the worse. Of these
      Maurice Connor was not one, though he had a stiff head enough of his own.
      Don&rsquo;t think I blame him for it; but true is the word that says, &lsquo;When
      liquor&rsquo;s in sense is out&rsquo;; and puff, at a breath, out he blasted his
      wonderful tune.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twas really then beyond all belief or telling the dancing. Maurice
      himself could not keep quiet; staggering now on one leg, now on the other,
      and rolling about like a ship in a cross sea, trying to humour the tune.
      There was his mother, too, moving her old bones as light as the youngest
      girl of them all; but her dancing, no, nor the dancing of all the rest, is
      not worthy the speaking about to the work that was going on down upon the
      strand. Every inch of it covered with all manner of fish jumping and
      plunging about to the music, and every moment more and more would tumble
      in and out of the water, charmed by the wonderful tune. Crabs of monstrous
      size spun round and round on one claw with the nimbleness of a dancing
      master, and twirled and tossed their other claws about like limbs that did
      not belong to them. It was a sight surprising to behold. But perhaps you
      may have heard of Father Florence Conry, as pleasant a man as one would
      wish to drink with of a hot summer&rsquo;s day; and he had rhymed out all about
      the dancing fishes so neatly that it would be a thousand pities not to
      give you his verses; so here they are in English:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          The big seals in motion,
          Like waves of the ocean,
               Or gouty feet prancing,
          Came heading the gay fish,
          Crabs, lobsters, and cray-fish,
               Determined on dancing.

          The sweet sounds they followed,
          The gasping cod swallow&rsquo;d&mdash;
               &lsquo;Twas wonderful, really;
          And turbot and flounder,
          &lsquo;Mid fish that were rounder,
               Just caper&rsquo;d as gaily.

          John-dories came tripping;
          Dull hake, by their skipping,
               To frisk it seem&rsquo;d given;
          Bright mackrel went springing,
          Like small rainbows winging
               Their flight up to heaven.

          The whiting and haddock
          Left salt water paddock
               This dance to be put in;
          Where skate with flat faces
          Edged out some old plaices;
               But soles kept their footing.

          Sprats and herrings in powers
          Of silvery showers
               All number out-numbered;
          And great ling so lengthy
          Was there in such plenty
               The shore was encumber&rsquo;d.

          The scallop and oyster
          Their two shells did roister,
               Like castanets flitting;
          While limpets moved clearly,
          And rocks very nearly
               With laughter were splitting.
</pre>
    <p>
      Never was such a hullabaloo in this world, before or since; &lsquo;twas as if
      heaven and earth were coming together; and all out of Maurice Connor&rsquo;s
      wonderful tune!
    </p>
    <p>
      In the height of all these doings, what should there be dancing among the
      outlandish set of fishes but a beautiful young woman&mdash;as beautiful as
      the dawn of day! She had a cocked hat upon her head; from under it her
      long green hair&mdash;just the colour of the sea&mdash;fell down behind,
      without hindrance to her dancing. Her teeth were like rows of pearls; her
      lips for all the world looked like red coral; and she had a shining gown
      pale green as the hollow of the wave, with little rows of purple and red
      seaweeds settled out upon it; for you never yet saw a lady, under the
      water or over the water, who had not a good notion of dressing herself
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up she danced at last to Maurice, who was flinging his feet from under him
      as fast as hops&mdash;for nothing in this world could keep still while
      that tune of his was going on&mdash;and says she to him, chanting it out
      with a voice as sweet as honey:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          I&rsquo;m a lady of honour
               Who live in the sea;
          Come down, Maurice Connor,
               And be married to me.
          Silver plates and gold dishes
               You shall have, and shall be
          The king of the fishes,
               When you&rsquo;re married to me.
</pre>
    <p>
      Drink was strong in Maurice&rsquo;s head, and out he chanted in return for her
      great civility. It is not every lady, may be, that would be after making
      such an offer to a blind piper; therefore &lsquo;twas only right in him to give
      her as good as she gave herself, so says Maurice:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          I&rsquo;m obliged to you, madam:
               Off a gold dish or plate,
          If a king, and I had &lsquo;em,
               I could dine in great state.
          With your own father&rsquo;s daughter
               I&rsquo;d be sure to agree,
          But to drink the salt water
               Wouldn&rsquo;t do so with me!
</pre>
    <p>
      The lady looked at him quite amazed, and swinging her head from side to
      side like a great scholar, &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;Maurice, if you&rsquo;re not a
      poet, where is poetry to be found?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way they kept on at it, framing high compliments; one answering
      the other, and their feet going with the music as fast as their tongues.
      All the fish kept dancing, too; Maurice heard the clatter and was afraid
      to stop playing lest it might be displeasing to the fish, and not knowing
      what so many of them may take it into their heads to do to him if they got
      vexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the lady with the green hair kept on coaxing Maurice with soft
      speeches, till at last she over persuaded him to promise to marry her, and
      be king over the fishes, great and small. Maurice was well fitted to be
      their king, if they wanted one that could make them dance; and he surely
      would drink, barring the salt water, with any fish of them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Maurice&rsquo;s mother saw him with that unnatural thing in the form of a
      green-haired lady as his guide, and he and she dancing down together so
      lovingly to the water&rsquo;s edge, through the thick of the fishes, she called
      out after him to stop and come back. &lsquo;Oh, then,&rsquo; says she, &lsquo;as if I was
      not widow enough before, there he is going away from me to be married to
      that scaly woman. And who knows but &lsquo;tis grandmother I may be to a hake or
      a cod&mdash;Lord help and pity me, but &lsquo;tis a mighty unnatural thing! And
      my be &lsquo;tis boiling and eating my own grandchild I&rsquo;ll be, with a bit of
      salt butter, and I not knowing it! Oh, Maurice, Maurice, if there&rsquo;s any
      love or nature left in you, come back to your own ould mother, who reared
      you like a decent Christian!&rsquo; Then the poor woman began to cry and sob so
      finely that it would do anyone good to hear her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maurice was not long getting to the rim of the water. There he kept
      playing and dancing on as if nothing was the matter, and a great
      thundering wave coming in towards him ready to swallow him up alive; but
      as he could not see it, he did not fear it. His mother it was who saw it
      plainly through the big tears that were rolling down her cheeks; and
      though she saw it, and her heart was aching as much as ever mother&rsquo;s heart
      ached for a son, she kept dancing, dancing all the time for the bare life
      of her. Certain it was she could not help it, for Maurice never stopped
      playing that wonderful tune of his.
    </p>
    <p>
      He only turned his ear to the sound of his mother&rsquo;s voice, fearing it
      might put him out in his steps, and all the answer he made back was,
      &lsquo;Whisht with you mother&mdash;sure I&rsquo;m going to be king over the fishes
      down in the sea, and for a token of luck, and a sign that I&rsquo;m alive and
      well, I&rsquo;ll send you in, every twelvemonth on this day, a piece of burned
      wood to Trafraska.&rsquo; Maurice had not the power to say a word more, for the
      strange lady with the green hair, seeing the wave just upon them, covered
      him up with herself in a thing like a cloak with a big hood to it, and the
      wave curling over twice as high as their heads, burst upon the strand,
      with a rush and a roar that might be heard as far as Cape Clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day twelvemonth the piece of burned wood came ashore in Trafraska. It
      was a queer thing for Maurice to think of sending all the way from the
      bottom of the sea. A gown or a pair of shoes would have been something
      like a present for his poor mother; but he had said it, and he kept his
      word. The bit of burned wood regularly came ashore on the appointed day
      for as good, ay, and better than a hundred years. The day is now
      forgotten, and may be that is the reason why people say how Maurice Connor
      has stopped sending the luck-token to his mother. Poor woman, she did not
      live to get as much as one of them; for what through the loss of Maurice,
      and the fear of eating her own grandchildren, she died in three weeks
      after the dance. Some say it was the fatigue that killed her, but
      whichever it was, Mrs. Connor was decently buried with her own people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seafaring people have often heard, off the coast of Kerry, on a still
      night, the sound of music coming up from the water; and some, who have had
      good ears, could plainly distinguish Maurice Connor&rsquo;s voice singing these
      words to his pipes&mdash;
    </p>

    <h2>
      The Rich Brother and the Poor Brother
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was once a rich old man who had two sons, and as his wife was dead,
      the elder lived with him, and helped him to look after his property. For a
      long time all went well; the young man got up very early in the morning,
      and worked hard all day, and at the end of every week his father counted
      up the money they had made, and rubbed his hands with delight, as he saw
      how big the pile of gold in the strong iron chest was becoming. &lsquo;It will
      soon be full now, and I shall have to buy a larger one,&rsquo; he said to
      himself, and so busy was he with the thought of his money, that he did not
      notice how bright his son&rsquo;s face had grown, nor how he sometimes started
      when he was spoken to, as if his mind was far away.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, however, the old man went to the city on business, which he had
      not done for three years at least. It was market day, and he met with many
      people he knew, and it was getting quite late when he turned into the inn
      yard, and bade an ostler saddle his horse, and bring it round directly.
      While he was waiting in the hall, the landlady came up for a gossip, and
      after a few remarks about the weather and the vineyards she asked him how
      he liked his new daughter-in-law, and whether he had been surprised at the
      marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man stared as he listened to her. &lsquo;Daughter-in-law? Marriage?&rsquo; 
      said he. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you are talking about! I&rsquo;ve got no
      daughter-in-law, and nobody has been married lately, that I ever heard
      of.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this was exactly what the landlady, who was very curious, wanted to
      find out; but she put on a look of great alarm, and exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, dear! I hope I have not made mischief. I had no idea&mdash;or, of
      course, I would not have spoken&mdash;but&rsquo;&mdash;and here she stopped and
      fumbled with her apron, as if she was greatly embarrassed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you have said so much you will have to say a little more,&rsquo; retorted
      the old man, a suspicion of what she meant darting across him; and the
      woman, nothing loth, answered as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, it was not all for buying or selling that your handsome son has been
      coming to town every week these many months past. And not by the shortest
      way, either! No, it was over the river he rode, and across the hill and
      past the cottage of Miguel the vine-keeper, whose daughter, they say, is
      the prettiest girl in the whole country side, though she is too white for
      my taste,&rsquo; and then the landlady paused again, and glanced up at the
      farmer, to see how he was taking it. She did not learn much. He was
      looking straight before him, his teeth set. But as she ceased to talk, he
      said quietly, &lsquo;Go on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is not much more to tell,&rsquo; replied the landlady, for she suddenly
      remembered that she must prepare supper for the hungry men who always
      stopped at the inn on market days, before starting for home, &lsquo;but one fine
      morning they both went to the little church on top of the hill, and were
      married. My cousin is servant to the priest, and she found out about it
      and told me. But good-day to you, sir; here is your horse, and I must
      hurry off to the kitchen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was lucky that the horse was sure-footed and knew the road, for his
      bridle hung loose on his neck, and his master took no heed of the way he
      was going. When the farm-house was reached, the man led the animal to the
      stable, and then went to look for his son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know everything&mdash;you have deceived me. Get out of my sight at once&mdash;I
      have done with you,&rsquo; he stammered, choking with passion as he came up to
      the young man, who was cutting a stick in front of the door, whistling
      gaily the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, father&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are no son of mine; I have only one now. Begone, or it will be the
      worse for you,&rsquo; and as he spoke he lifted up his whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man shrank back. He feared lest his father should fall down in a
      fit, his face was so red and his eyes seemed bursting from his head. But
      it was no use staying: perhaps next morning the old man might listen to
      reason, though in his heart the son felt that he would never take back his
      words. So he turned slowly away, and walked heavily along a path which
      ended in a cave on the side of his hill, and there he sat through the
      night, thinking of what had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, he had been wrong, there was no doubt of that, and he did not quite
      know how it had come about. He had meant to have told his father all about
      it, and he was sure, quite sure, that if once the old man had seen his
      wife, he would have forgiven her poverty on account of her great beauty
      and goodness. But he had put it off from day to day, hoping always for a
      better opportunity, and now this was the end!
    </p>
    <p>
      If the son had no sleep that night, no more had the father, and as soon as
      the sun rose, he sent a messenger into the great city with orders to bring
      back the younger brother. When he arrived the farmer did not waste words,
      but informed him that he was now his only heir, and would inherit all his
      lands and money, and that he was to come and live at home, and to help
      manage the property.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though very pleased at the thought of becoming such a rich man&mdash;for
      the brothers had never cared much for each other&mdash;the younger would
      rather have stayed where he was, for he soon got tired of the country, and
      longed for a town life. However, this he kept to himself, and made the
      best of things, working hard like his brother before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way the years went on, but the crops were not so good as they had
      been, and the old man gave orders that some fine houses he was building in
      the city should be left unfinished, for it would take all the savings to
      complete them. As to the elder son, he would never even hear his name
      mentioned, and died at last without ever seeing his face, leaving to the
      younger, as he had promised, all his lands, as well as his money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the son whom he had disinherited had grown poorer and poorer.
      He and his wife were always looking out for something to do, and never
      spent a penny that they could help, but luck was against them, and at the
      time of his father&rsquo;s death they had hardly bread to eat or clothes to
      cover them. If there had been only himself, he would have managed to get
      on somehow, but he could not bear to watch his children becoming weaker
      day by day, and swallowing his pride, at length he crossed the mountains
      to his old home where his brother was living.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the first time for long that the two men had come face to face, and
      they looked at each other in silence. Then tears rose in the eyes of the
      elder, but winking them hastily away, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brother, it is not needful that I should tell you how poor I am; you can
      see that for yourself. I have not come to beg for money, but only to ask
      if you will give me those unfinished houses of yours in the city, and I
      will make them watertight, so that my wife and children can live in them,
      and that will save our rent. For as they are, they profit you nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And the younger brother listened and pitied him, and gave him the houses
      that he asked for, and the elder went away happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some years things went on as they were, and then the rich brother
      began to feel lonely, and thought to himself that he was getting older,
      and it was time for him to be married. The wife he chose was very wealthy,
      but she was also very greedy, and however much she had, she always wanted
      more. She was, besides, one of those unfortunate people who invariably
      fancy that the possessions of other people must be better than their own.
      Many a time her poor husband regretted the day that he had first seen her,
      and often her meanness and shabby ways put him to shame. But he had not
      the courage to rule her, and she only got worse and worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      After she had been married a few months the bride wanted to go into the
      city and buy herself some new dresses. She had never been there before,
      and when she had finished her shopping, she thought she would pay a visit
      to her unknown sister-in-law, and rest for a bit. The house she was
      seeking was in a broad street, and ought to have been very magnificent,
      but the carved stone portico enclosed a mean little door of rough wood,
      while a row of beautiful pillars led to nothing. The dwelling on each side
      were in the same unfinished condition, and water trickled down the walls.
      Most people would have considered it a wretched place, and turned their
      backs on it as soon as they could, but this lady saw that by spending some
      money the houses could be made as splendid as they were originally
      intended to be, and she instantly resolved to get them for herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of this idea she walked up the marble staircase, and entered the
      little room where her sister-in-law sat, making clothes for her children.
      The bride seemed full of interest in the houses, and asked a great many
      questions about them, so that her new relations liked her much better than
      they expected, and hoped they might be good friends. However, as soon as
      she reached home, she went straight to her husband, and told him that he
      must get back those houses from his brother, as they would exactly suit
      her, and she could easily make them into a palace as fine as the king&rsquo;s.
      But her husband only told her that she might buy houses in some other part
      of the town, for she could not have those, as he had long since made a
      gift of them to his brother, who had lived there for many years past.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this answer the wife grew very angry. She began to cry, and made such a
      noise that all the neighbours heard her and put their heads out of the
      windows, to see what was the matter. &lsquo;It was absurd,&rsquo; she sobbed out,
      &lsquo;quite unjust. Indeed, if you came to think of it, the gift was worth
      nothing, as when her husband made it he was a bachelor, and since then he
      had been married, and she had never given her consent to any such thing.&rsquo; 
      And so she lamented all day and all night, till the poor man was nearly
      worried to death; and at last he did what she wished, and summoned his
      brother in a court of law to give up the houses which, he said, had only
      been lent to him. But when the evidence on both sides had been heard, the
      judge decided in favour of the poor man, which made the rich lady more
      furious than ever, and she determined not to rest until she had gained the
      day. If one judge would not give her the houses another should, and so
      time after time the case was tried over again, till at last it came before
      the highest judge of all, in the city of Evora. Her husband was heartily
      tired and ashamed of the whole affair, but his weakness in not putting a
      stop to it in the beginning had got him into this difficulty, and now he
      was forced to go on.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the same day the two brothers set out on their journey to the city, the
      rich one on horseback, with plenty of food in his knapsack, the poor one
      on foot with nothing but a piece of bread and four onions to eat on the
      way. The road was hilly and neither could go very fast, and when night
      fell, they were both glad to see some lights in a window a little distance
      in front of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights turned out to have been placed there by a farmer, who had
      planned to have a particularly good supper as it was his wife&rsquo;s birthday,
      and bade the rich man enter and sit down, while he himself took the horse
      to the stable. The poor man asked timidly if he might spend the night in a
      corner, adding that he had brought his own supper with him. Another time
      permission might have been refused him, for the farmer was no lover of
      humble folk, but now he gave the elder brother leave to come in, pointing
      out a wooden chair where he could sit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper was soon served, and very glad the younger brother was to eat it,
      for his long ride had made him very hungry. The farmer&rsquo;s wife, however,
      would touch nothing, and at last declared that the only supper she wanted
      was one of the onions the poor man was cooking at the fire. Of course he
      gave it to her, though he would gladly have eaten it himself, as three
      onions are not much at the end of a long day&rsquo;s walk, and soon after they
      all went to sleep, the poor man making himself as comfortable as he could
      in his corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few hours later the farmer was aroused by the cries and groans of his
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I feel so ill, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m going to die,&rsquo; wept she. &lsquo;It was that
      onion, I know it was. I wish I had never eaten it. It must have been
      poisoned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the man has poisoned you he shall pay for it,&rsquo; said her husband, and
      seizing a thick stick he ran downstairs and began to beat the poor man,
      who had been sound asleep, and had nothing to defend himself with.
      Luckily, the noise aroused the younger brother, who jumped up and snatched
      the stick from the farmer&rsquo;s hand, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are both going to Evora to try a law-suit. Come too, and accuse him
      there if he has attempted to rob you or murder you, but don&rsquo;t kill him
      now, or you will get yourself into trouble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, perhaps you are right,&rsquo; answered the farmer, &lsquo;but the sooner that
      fellow has his deserts, the better I shall be pleased,&rsquo; and without more
      words he went to the stables and brought out a horse for himself and also
      the black Andalusian mare ridden by the rich man, while the poor brother,
      fearing more ill-treatment, started at once on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now all that night it had rained heavily, and did not seem likely to stop,
      and in some places the road was so thick with mud that it was almost
      impossible to get across it. In one spot it was so very bad that a mule
      laden with baggage had got stuck in it, and tug as he might, his master
      was quite unable to pull him out. The muleteer in despair appealed to the
      two horseman, who were carefully skirting the swamp at some distance off,
      but they paid no heed to his cries, and he began to talk cheerfully to his
      mule, hoping to keep up his spirits, declaring that if the poor beast
      would only have a little patience help was sure to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it did, for very soon the poor brother reached the place,
      bespattered with mud from head to foot, but ready to do all he could to
      help with the mule and his master. First they set about finding some stout
      logs of wood to lay down on the marsh so that they could reach the mule,
      for by this time his frantic struggles had broken his bridle, and he was
      deeper in than ever. Stepping cautiously along the wood, the poor man
      contrived to lay hold of the animal&rsquo;s tale, and with a desperate effort
      the mule managed to regain his footing on dry ground, but at the cost of
      leaving his tail in the poor man&rsquo;s hand. When he saw this the muleteer&rsquo;s
      anger knew no bounds, and forgetting that without the help given him he
      would have lost his mule altogether, he began to abuse the poor man,
      declaring that he had ruined his beast, and the law would make him pay for
      it. Then, jumping on the back of the mule, which was so glad to be out of
      the choking mud that he did not seem to mind the loss of his tail, the
      ungrateful wretch rode on, and that evening reached the inn at Evora,
      where the rich man and the farmer had already arrived for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the poor brother walked wearily along, wondering what other
      dreadful adventures were in store for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall certainly be condemned for one or other of them,&rsquo; thought he
      sadly; &lsquo;and after all, if I have to die, I would rather choose my own
      death than leave it to my enemies,&rsquo; and as soon as he entered Evora he
      looked about for a place suitable for carrying out the plan he had made.
      At length he found what he sought, but as it was too late and too dark for
      him to make sure of success, he curled himself up under a doorway, and
      slept till morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although it was winter, the sun rose in a clear sky, and its rays felt
      almost warm when the poor man got up and shook himself. He intended it to
      be the day of his death, but in spite of that, and of the fact that he was
      leaving his wife and children behind him, he felt almost cheerful. He had
      struggled so long, and was so very, very tired; but he would not have
      minded that if he could have proved his innocence, and triumphed over his
      enemies. However, they had all been too clever for him, and he had no
      strength to fight any more. So he mounted the stone steps that led to the
      battlements of the city, and stopped for a moment to gaze about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that an old sick man who lived near by had begged to be
      carried out and to be laid at the foot of the wall so that the beams of
      the rising sun might fall upon him, and he would be able to talk with his
      friends as they passed by to their work. Little did he guess that on top
      of the battlements, exactly over his head, stood a man who was taking his
      last look at the same sun, before going to his death that awaited him. But
      so it was; and as the steeple opposite was touched by the golden light,
      the poor man shut his eyes and sprang forward. The wall was high, and he
      flew rapidly through the air, but it was not the ground he touched, only
      the body of the sick man, who rolled over and died without a groan. As for
      the other, he was quite unhurt, and was slowly rising to his feet when his
      arms were suddenly seized and held.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have killed our father, do you see? do you see?&rsquo; cried two young men,
      &lsquo;and you will come with us this instant before the judge, and answer for
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your father? but I don&rsquo;t know him. What do you mean?&rsquo; asked the poor man,
      who was quite bewildered with his sudden rush through the air, and could
      not think why he should be accused of this fresh crime. But he got no
      reply, and was only hurried through the streets to the court-house, where
      his brother, the muleteer, and the farmer had just arrived, all as angry
      as ever, all talking at once, till the judge entered and ordered them to
      be silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will hear you one by one,&rsquo; he said, and motioned the younger brother to
      begin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not take long to state his case. The unfinished houses were his,
      left him with the rest of the property by his father, and his brother
      refused to give them up. In answer, the poor man told, in a few words, how
      he had begged the houses from his brother, and produced the deed of gift
      which made him their owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge listened quietly and asked a few questions; then he gave his
      verdict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The houses shall remain the property of the man to whom they were given,
      and to whom they belong. And as you,&rsquo; he added, turning to the younger
      brother, &lsquo;brought this accusation knowing full well it was wicked and
      unjust, I order you, besides losing the houses, to pay a thousand pounds
      damages to your brother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The rich man heard the judge with rage in his heart, the poor man with
      surprise and gratitude. But he was not safe yet, for now it was the turn
      of the farmer. The judge could hardly conceal a smile at the story, and
      inquired if the wife was dead before the farmer left the house, and
      received for answer that he was in such a hurry for justice to be done
      that he had not waited to see. Then the poor man told his tale, and once
      more judgment was given in his favour, while twelve hundred pounds was
      ordered to be paid him. As for the muleteer, he was informed very plainly
      that he had proved himself mean and ungrateful for the help that had been
      given him, and as a punishment he must pay to the poor man a fine of fifty
      pounds, and hand him over the mule till his tail had grown again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lastly, there came the two sons of the sick man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the wretch who killed our father,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;and we demand that
      he should die also.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How did you kill him?&rsquo; asked the judge, turning to the accused, and the
      poor man told how he had leaped from the wall, not knowing that anyone was
      beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, this is my judgment,&rsquo; replied the judge, when they had all spoken:
      &lsquo;Let the accused sit under the wall, and let the sons of the dead man jump
      from the top and fall on him and kill him, and if they will not to this,
      then they are condemned to pay eight hundred pounds for their false
      accusation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young men looked at each other, and slowly shook their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will pay the fine,&rsquo; said they, and the judge nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the poor man rode the mule home, and brought back to his family enough
      money to keep them in comfort to the end of their days.
    </p>

      Adapted from the Portuguese.

    <h2>
      The One-Handed Girl
    </h2>
    <p>
      An old couple once lived in a hut under a grove of palm trees, and they
      had one son and one daughter. They were all very happy together for many
      years, and then the father became very ill, and felt he was going to die.
      He called his children to the place where he lay on the floor&mdash;for no
      one had any beds in that country&mdash;and said to his son, &lsquo;I have no
      herds of cattle to leave you&mdash;only the few things there are in the
      house&mdash;for I am a poor man, as you know. But choose: will you have my
      blessing or my property?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your property, certainly,&rsquo; answered the son, and his father nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you?&rsquo; asked the old man of the girl, who stood by her brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will have blessing,&rsquo; she answered, and her father gave her much
      blessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      That night he died, and his wife and son and daughter mourned for him
      seven days, and gave him a burial according to the custom of his people.
      But hardly was the time of mourning over, than the mother was attacked by
      a disease which was common in that country.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going away from you,&rsquo; she said to her children, in a faint voice;
      &lsquo;but first, my son, choose which you will have: blessing or property.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Property, certainly,&rsquo; answered the son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you, my daughter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will have blessing,&rsquo; said the girl; and her mother gave her much
      blessing, and that night she died.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the days of mourning were ended, the brother bade his sister put
      outside the hut all that belonged to his father and his mother. So the
      girl put them out, and he took them away, save only a small pot and a
      vessel in which she could clean her corn. But she had no corn to clean.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat at home, sad and hungry, when a neighbour knocked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My pot has cracked in the fire, lend me yours to cook my supper in, and I
      will give you a handful of corn in return.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And the girl was glad, and that night she was able to have supper herself,
      and next day another woman borrowed her pot, and then another and another,
      for never were known so many accidents as befell the village pots at that
      time. She soon grew quite fat with all the corn she earned with the help
      of her pot, and then one evening she picked up a pumpkin seed in a corner,
      and planted it near her well, and it sprang up, and gave her many
      pumpkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last it happened that a youth from her village passed through the place
      where the girl&rsquo;s brother was, and the two met and talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What news is there of my sister?&rsquo; asked the young man, with whom things
      had gone badly, for he was idle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is fat and well-liking,&rsquo; replied the youth, &lsquo;for the women borrow her
      mortar to clean their corn, and borrow her pot to cook it in, and for al
      this they give her more food than she can eat.&rsquo; And he went his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the brother was filled with envy at the words of the man, and he set
      out at once, and before dawn he had reached the hut, and saw the pot and
      the mortar were standing outside. He slung them over his shoulders and
      departed, pleased with his own cleverness; but when his sister awoke and
      sought for the pot to cook her corn for breakfast, she could find it
      nowhere. At length she said to herself,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, some thief must have stolen them while I slept. I will go and see
      if any of my pumpkins are ripe.&rsquo; And indeed they were, and so many that
      the tree was almost broken by the weight of them. So she ate what she
      wanted and took the others to the village, and gave them in exchange for
      corn, and the women said that no pumpkins were as sweet as these, and that
      she was to bring every day all that she had. In this way she earned more
      than she needed for herself, and soon was able to get another mortar and
      cooking pot in exchange for her corn. Then she thought she was quite rich.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unluckily someone else thought so too, and this was her brother&rsquo;s wife,
      who had heard all about the pumpkin tree, and sent her slave with a
      handful of grain to buy her a pumpkin. At first the girl told him that so
      few were left that she could not spare any; but when she found that he
      belonged to her brother, she changed her mind, and went out to the tree
      and gathered the largest and the ripest that was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take this one,&rsquo; she said to the slave, &lsquo;and carry it back to your
      mistress, but tell her to keep the corn, as the pumpkin is a gift.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The brother&rsquo;s wife was overjoyed at the sight of the fruit, and when she
      tasted it, she declared it was the nicest she had ever eaten. Indeed, all
      night she thought of nothing else, and early in the morning she called
      another slave (for she was a rich woman) and bade him go and ask for
      another pumpkin. But the girl, who had just been out to look at her tree,
      told him that they were all eaten, so he went back empty-handed to his
      mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening her husband returned from hunting a long way off, and found
      his wife in tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I sent a slave with some grain to your sister to buy some pumpkins, but
      she would not sell me any, and told me there were none, though I know she
      lets other people buy them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, never mind now&mdash;go to sleep,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and to-morrow I will
      go and pull up the pumpkin tree, and that will punish her for treating you
      so badly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So before sunrise he got up and set out for his sister&rsquo;s house, and found
      her cleaning some corn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you refuse to sell my wife a pumpkin yesterday when she wanted
      one?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old ones are finished, and the new ones are not yet come,&rsquo; answered
      the girl. &lsquo;When her slave arrived two days ago, there were only four left;
      but I gave him one, and would take no corn for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not believe you; you have sold them all to other people. I shall go
      and cut down the pumpkin,&rsquo; cried her brother in a rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you cut down the pumpkin you shall cut off my hand with it,&rsquo; exclaimed
      the girl, running up to her tree and catching hold of it. But her brother
      followed, and with one blow cut off the pumpkin and her hand too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he went into the house and took away everything he could find, and
      sold the house to a friend of his who had long wished to have it, and his
      sister had no home to go to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile she had bathed her arm carefully, and bound on it some healing
      leaves that grew near by, and wrapped a cloth round the leaves, and went
      to hide in the forest, that her brother might not find her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      For seven days she wandered about, eating only the fruit that hung from
      the trees above her, and every night she climbed up and tucked herself
      safely among the creepers which bound together the big branches, so that
      neither lions nor tigers nor panthers might get at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she woke up on the seventh morning she saw from her perch smoke
      coming up from a little town on the edge of the forest. The sight of the
      huts made her feel more lonely and helpless than before. She longed
      desperately for a draught of milk from a gourd, for there were no streams
      in that part, and she was very thirsty, but how was she to earn anything
      with only one hand? And at this thought her courage failed, and she began
      to cry bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that the king&rsquo;s son had come out from the town very early to
      shoot birds, and when the sun grew hot he left tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will lie here and rest under this tree,&rsquo; he said to his attendants.
      &lsquo;You can go and shoot instead, and I will just have this slave to stay
      with me!&rsquo; Away they went, and the young man fell asleep, and slept long.
      Suddenly he was awakened by something wet and salt falling on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is that? Is it raining?&rsquo; he said to his slave. &lsquo;Go and look.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, master, it is not raining,&rsquo; answered the slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then climb up the tree and see what it is,&rsquo; and the slave climbed up, and
      came back and told his master that a beautiful girl was sitting up there,
      and that it must have been her tears which had fallen on the face of the
      king&rsquo;s son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why was she crying?&rsquo; inquired the prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot tell&mdash;I did not dare to ask her; but perhaps she would tell
      you.&rsquo; And the master, greatly wondering, climbed up the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter with you?&rsquo; said he gently, and, as she only sobbed
      louder, he continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you a woman, or a spirit of the woods?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am a woman,&rsquo; she answered slowly, wiping her eyes with a leaf of the
      creeper that hung about her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why do you cry?&rsquo; he persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have many things to cry for,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;more than you could ever
      guess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come home with me,&rsquo; said the prince; &lsquo;it is not very far. Come home to my
      father and mother. I am a king&rsquo;s son.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why are you here?&rsquo; she said, opening her eyes and staring at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Once every month I and my friends shoot birds in the forest,&rsquo; he
      answered, &lsquo;but I was tired and bade them leave me to rest. And you&mdash;what
      are you doing up in this tree?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At that she began to cry again, and told the king&rsquo;s son all that had
      befallen her since the death of her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot come down with you, for I do not like anyone to see me,&rsquo; she
      ended with a sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I will manage all that,&rsquo; said the king&rsquo;s son, and swinging himself to
      a lower branch, he bade his slave go quickly into the town, and bring back
      with him four strong men and a curtained litter. When the man was gone,
      the girl climbed down, and hid herself on the ground in some bushes. Very
      soon the slave returned with the litter, which was placed on the ground
      close to the bushes where the girl lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now go, all of you, and call my attendants, for I do not wish to say here
      any longer,&rsquo; he said to the men, and as soon as they were out of sight he
      bade the girl get into the litter, and fasten the curtains tightly. Then
      he got in on the other side, and waited till his attendants came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter, O son of a king?&rsquo; asked they, breathless with
      running.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I am ill; I am cold,&rsquo; he said, and signing to the bearers, he
      drew the curtains, and was carried through the forest right inside his own
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell my father and mother that I have a fever, and want some gruel,&rsquo; said
      he, &lsquo;and bid them send it quickly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So the slave hastened to the king&rsquo;s palace and gave his message, which
      troubled both the king and the queen greatly. A pot of hot gruel was
      instantly prepared, and carried over to the sick man, and as soon as the
      council which was sitting was over, the king and his ministers went to pay
      him a visit, bearing a message from the queen that she would follow a
      little later.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the prince had pretended to be ill in order to soften his parent&rsquo;s
      hearts, and the next day he declared he felt better, and, getting into his
      litter, was carried to the palace in state, drums being beaten all along
      the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dismounted at the foot of the steps and walked up, a great parasol
      being held over his head by a slave. Then he entered the cool, dark room
      where his father and mother were sitting, and said to them:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw a girl yesterday in the forest whom I wish to marry, and, unknown
      to my attendants, I brought her back to my house in a litter. Give me your
      consent, I beg, for no other woman pleases me as well, even though she has
      but one hand!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course the king and queen would have preferred a daughter-in-law with
      two hands, and one who could have brought riches with her, but they could
      not bear to say &lsquo;No&rsquo; to their son, so they told him it should be as he
      chose, and that the wedding feast should be prepared immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl could scarcely believe her good fortune, and, in gratitude for
      all the kindness shown her, was so useful and pleasant to her husband&rsquo;s
      parents that they soon loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and bye a baby was born to her, and soon after that the prince was sent
      on a journey by his father to visit some of the distant towns of the
      kingdom, and to set right things that had gone wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had he started than the girl&rsquo;s brother, who had wasted all the
      riches his wife had brought him in recklessness and folly, and was now
      very poor, chanced to come into the town, and as he passed he heard a man
      say, &lsquo;Do you know that the king&rsquo;s son has married a woman who has lost one
      of her hands?&rsquo; On hearing these words the brother stopped and asked,
      &lsquo;Where did he find such a woman?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the forest,&rsquo; answered the man, and the cruel brother guessed at once
      it must be his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great rage took possession of his soul as he thought of the girl whom he
      had tried to ruin being after all so much better off than himself, and he
      vowed that he would work her ill. Therefore that very afternoon he made
      his way to the palace and asked to see the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was admitted to his presence, he knelt down and touched the ground
      with his forehead, and the king bade him stand up and tell wherefore he
      had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the kindness of your heart have you been deceived, O king,&rsquo; said he.
      &lsquo;Your son has married a girl who has lost a hand. Do you know why she had
      lost it? She was a witch, and has wedded three husbands, and each husband
      she has put to death with her arts. Then the people of the town cut off
      her hand, and turned her into the forest. And what I say is true, for her
      town is my town also.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The king listened, and his face grew dark. Unluckily he had a hasty
      temper, and did not stop to reason, and, instead of sending to the town,
      and discovering people who knew his daughter-in-law and could have told
      him how hard she had worked and how poor she had been, he believed all the
      brother&rsquo;s lying words, and made the queen believe them too. Together they
      took counsel what they should do, and in the end they decided that they
      also would put her out of the town. But this did not content the brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kill her,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;It is no more than she deserves for daring to marry
      the king&rsquo;s son. Then she can do no more hurt to anyone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We cannot kill her,&rsquo; answered they; &lsquo;if we did, our son would assuredly
      kill us. Let us do as the others did, and put her out of the town. And
      with this the envious brother was forced to be content.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poor girl loved her husband very much, but just then the baby was more
      to her than all else in the world, and as long as she had him with her,
      she did not very much mind anything. So, taking her son on her arm, and
      hanging a little earthen pot for cooking round her neck, she left her
      house with its great peacock fans and slaves and seats of ivory, and
      plunged into the forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a while she walked, not knowing whither she went, then by and bye she
      grew tired, and sat under a tree to rest and to hush her baby to sleep.
      Suddenly she raised her eyes, and saw a snake wriggling from under the
      bushes towards her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am a dead woman,&rsquo; she said to herself, and stayed quite still, for
      indeed she was too frightened to move. In another minute the snake had
      reached her side, and to her surprise he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Open your earthen pot, and let me go in. Save me from sun, and I will
      save you from rain,&rsquo; and she opened the pot, and when the snake had
      slipped in, she put on the cover. Soon she beheld another snake coming
      after the other one, and when it had reached her it stopped and said, &lsquo;Did
      you see a small grey snake pass this way just now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;it was going very quickly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I must hurry and catch it up,&rsquo; replied the second snake, and it
      hastened on.
    </p>
    <p>
      When it was out of sight, a voice from the pot said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Uncover me,&rsquo; and she lifted the lid, and the little grey snake slid
      rapidly to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am safe now,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;But tell me, where are you going?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot tell you, for I do not know,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;I am just wandering
      in the wood.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Follow me, and let us go home together,&rsquo; said the snake, and the girl
      followed his through the forest and along the green paths, till they came
      to a great lake, where they stopped to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The sun is hot,&rsquo; said the snake, &lsquo;and you have walked far. Take your baby
      and bathe in that cool place where the boughs of the tree stretch far over
      the water.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I will,&rsquo; answered she, and they went in. The baby splashed and
      crowed with delight, and then he gave a spring and fell right in, down,
      down, down, and his mother could not find him, though she searched all
      among the reeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of terror, she made her way back to the bank, and called to the
      snake, &lsquo;My baby is gone!&mdash;he is drowned, and never shall I see him
      again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go in once more,&rsquo; said the snake, &lsquo;and feel everywhere, even among the
      trees that have their roots in the water, lest perhaps he may be held fast
      there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly she went back and felt everywhere with her whole hand, even
      putting her fingers into the tiniest crannies, where a crab could hardly
      have taken shelter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, he is not here,&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;How am I to live without him?&rsquo; But the
      snake took no notice, and only answered, &lsquo;Put in your other arm too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the use of that?&rsquo; she asked, &lsquo;when it has no hand to feel with?&rsquo; 
      but all the same she did as she was bid, and in an instant the wounded arm
      touched something round and soft, lying between two stones in a clump of
      reeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My baby, my baby!&rsquo; she shouted, and lifted him up, merry and laughing,
      and not a bit hurt or frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you found him this time?&rsquo; asked the snake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, oh, yes!&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;and, why&mdash;why&mdash;I have got my hand
      back again!&rsquo; and from sheer joy she burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The snake let her weep for a little while, and then he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now we will journey on to my family, and we will all repay you for the
      kindness you showed to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have done more than enough in giving me back my hand,&rsquo; replied the
      girl; but the snake only smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be quick, lest the sun should set,&rsquo; he answered, and began to wriggle
      along so fast that the girl could hardly follow him.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and bye they arrived at the house in a tree where the snake lived, when
      he was not travelling with his father and mother. And he told them all his
      adventures, and how he had escaped from his enemy. The father and mother
      snake could not do enough to show their gratitude. They made their guest
      lie down on a hammock woven of the strong creepers which hung from bough
      to bough, till she was quite rested after her wanderings, while they
      watched the baby and gave him milk to drink from the cocoa-nuts which they
      persuaded their friends the monkeys to crack for them. They even managed
      to carry small fruit tied up in their tails for the baby&rsquo;s mother, who
      felt at last that she was safe and at peace. Not that she forgot her
      husband, for she often thought of him and longed to show him her son, and
      in the night she would sometimes lie awake and wonder where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this manner many weeks passed by.
    </p>
    <p>
      And what was the prince doing?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, he had fallen very ill when he was on the furthest border of the
      kingdom, and he was nursed by some kind people who did not know who he
      was, so that the king and queen heard nothing about him. When he was
      better he made his way home again, and into his father&rsquo;s palace, where he
      found a strange man standing behind the throne with the peacock&rsquo;s
      feathers. This was his wife&rsquo;s brother, whom the king had taken into high
      favour, though, of course, the prince was quite ignorant of what had
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the king and queen stared at their son, as if he had been
      unknown to them; he had grown so thin and weak during his illness that his
      shoulders were bowed like those of an old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you forgotten me so soon?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of his voice they gave a cry and ran towards him, and poured
      out questions as to what had happened, and why he looked like that. But
      the prince did not answer any of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is my wife?&rsquo; he said. There was a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the queen replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dead!&rsquo; he repeated, stepping a little backwards. &lsquo;And my child?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is dead too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man stood silent. Then he said, &lsquo;Show me their graves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the king, who had been feeling rather uncomfortable, took
      heart again, for had he not prepared two beautiful tombs for his son to
      see, so that he might never, never guess what had been done to his wife?
      All these months the king and queen had been telling each other how good
      and merciful they had been not to take her brother&rsquo;s advice and to put her
      to death. But now, this somehow did not seem so certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the king led the way to the courtyard just behind the palace, and
      through the gate into a beautiful garden where stood two splendid tombs in
      a green space under the trees. The prince advanced alone, and, resting his
      head against the stone, he burst into tears. His father and mother stood
      silently behind with a curious pang in their souls which they did not
      quite understand. Could it be that they were ashamed of themselves?
    </p>
    <p>
      But after a while the prince turned round, and walking past them in to the
      palace he bade the slaves bring him mourning. For seven days no one saw
      him, but at the end of them he went out hunting, and helped his father
      rule his people. Only no one dared to speak to him of his wife and son.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last one morning, after the girl had been lying awake all night
      thinking of her husband, she said to her friend the snake:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have all shown me much kindness, but now I am well again, and want to
      go home and hear some news of my husband, and if he still mourns for me!&rsquo; 
      Now the heart of the snake was sad at her words, but he only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, thus it must be; go and bid farewell to my father and mother, but if
      they offer you a present, see that you take nothing but my father&rsquo;s ring
      and my mother&rsquo;s casket.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So she went to the parent snakes, who wept bitterly at the thought of
      losing her, and offered her gold and jewels as much as she could carry in
      remembrance of them. But the girl shook her head and pushed the shining
      heap away from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall never forget you, never,&rsquo; she said in a broken voice, &lsquo;but the
      only tokens I will accept from you are that little ring and this old
      casket.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The two snakes looked at each other in dismay. The ring and the casket
      were the only things they did not want her to have. Then after a short
      pause they spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why do you want the ring and casket so much? Who has told you of them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, nobody; it is just my fancy,&rsquo; answered she. But the old snakes shook
      their heads and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not so; it is our son who told you, and, as he said, so it must be. If
      you need food, or clothes, or a house, tell the ring and it will find them
      for you. And if you are unhappy or in danger, tell the casket and it will
      set things right.&rsquo; Then they both gave her their blessing, and she picked
      up her baby and went her way.
    </p>
    <p>
      She walked for a long time, till at length she came near the town where
      her husband and his father dwelt. Here she stopped under a grove of palm
      trees, and told the ring that she wanted a house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is ready, mistress,&rsquo; whispered a queer little voice which made her
      jump, and, looking behind her, she saw a lovely palace made of the finest
      woods, and a row of slaves with tall fans bowing before the door. Glad
      indeed was she to enter, for she was very tired, and, after eating a good
      supper of fruit and milk which she found in one of the rooms, she flung
      herself down on a pile of cushions and went to sleep with her baby beside
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here she stayed quietly, and every day the baby grew taller and stronger,
      and very soon he could run about and even talk. Of course the neighbours
      had a great deal to say about the house which had been built so quickly&mdash;so
      very quickly&mdash;on the outskirts of the town, and invented all kinds of
      stories about the rich lady who lived in it. And by and bye, when the king
      returned with his son from the wars, some of these tales reached his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is really very odd about that house under the palms,&rsquo; he said to the
      queen; &lsquo;I must find out something of the lady whom no one ever sees. I
      daresay it is not a lady at all, but a gang of conspirators who want to
      get possession of my throne. To-morrow I shall take my son and my chief
      ministers and insist on getting inside.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after sunrise next day the prince&rsquo;s wife was standing on a little
      hill behind the house, when she saw a cloud of dust coming through the
      town. A moment afterwards she heard faintly the roll of the drums that
      announced the king&rsquo;s presence, and saw a crowd of people approaching the
      grove of palms. Her heart beat fast. Could her husband be among them? In
      any case they must not discover her there; so just bidding the ring
      prepare some food for them, she ran inside, and bound a veil of golden
      gauze round her head and face. Then, taking the child&rsquo;s hand, she went to
      the door and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the whole procession came up, and she stepped forward and
      begged them to come in and rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Willingly,&rsquo; answered the king; &lsquo;go first, and we will follow you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They followed her into a long dark room, in which was a table covered with
      gold cups and baskets filled with dates and cocoa-nuts and all kinds of
      ripe yellow fruits, and the king and the prince sat upon cushions and were
      served by slaves, while the ministers, among whom she recognised her own
      brother, stood behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I owe all my misery to him,&rsquo; she said to herself. &lsquo;From the first he
      has hated me,&rsquo; but outwardly she showed nothing. And when the king asked
      her what news there was in the town she only answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have ridden far; eat first, and drink, for you must be hungry and
      thirsty, and then I will tell you my news.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You speak sense,&rsquo; answered the king, and silence prevailed for some time
      longer. Then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, lady, I have finished, and am refreshed, therefore tell me, I pray
      you, who you are, and whence you come? But, first, be seated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She bowed her head and sat down on a big scarlet cushion, drawing her
      little boy, who was asleep in a corner, on to her knee, and began to tell
      the story of her life. As her brother listened, he would fain have left
      the house and hidden himself in the forest, but it was his duty to wave
      the fan of peacock&rsquo;s feathers over the king&rsquo;s head to keep off the flies,
      and he knew he would be seized by the royal guards if he tried to desert
      his post. He must stay where he was, there was no help for it, and luckily
      for him the king was too much interested in the tale to notice that the
      fan had ceased moving, and that flies were dancing right on the top of his
      thick curly hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story went on, but the story-teller never once looked at the prince,
      even through her veil, though he on his side never moved his eyes from
      her. When she reached the part where she had sat weeping in the tree, the
      king&rsquo;s son could restrain himself no longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is my wife,&rsquo; he cried, springing to where she sat with the sleeping
      child in her lap. &lsquo;They have lied to me, and you are not dead after all,
      nor the boy either! But what has happened? Why did they lie to me? and why
      did you leave my house where you were safe?&rsquo; And he turned and looked
      fiercely at his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me finish my tale first, and then you will know,&rsquo; answered she,
      throwing back her veil, and she told how her brother had come to the
      palace and accused her of being a witch, and had tried to persuade the
      king to slay her. &lsquo;But he would not do that,&rsquo; she continued softly, &lsquo;and
      after all, if I had stayed on in your house, I should never have met the
      snake, nor have got my hand back again. So let us forget all about it, and
      be happy once more, for see! our son is growing quite a big boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what shall be done to your brother?&rsquo; asked the king, who was glad to
      think that someone had acted in this matter worse than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Put him out of the town,&rsquo; answered she.

    <h2>
      The Bones of Djulung
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a beautiful island that lies in the southern seas, where chains of gay
      orchids bind the trees together, and the days and nights are equally long
      and nearly equally hot, there once lived a family of seven sisters. Their
      father and mother were dead, and they had no brothers, so the eldest girl
      ruled over the rest, and they all did as she bade them. One sister had to
      clean the house, a second carried water from the spring in the forest, a
      third cooked their food, while to the youngest fell the hardest task of
      all, for she had to cut and bring home the wood which was to keep the fire
      continually burning. This was very hot and tiring work, and when she had
      fed the fire and heaped up in a corner the sticks that were to supply it
      till the next day, she often threw herself down under a tree, and went
      sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning, however, as she was staggering along with her bundle on her
      back, she thought that the river which flowed past their hut looked so
      cool and inviting that she determined to bathe in it, instead of taking
      her usual nap. Hastily piling up her load by the fire, and thrusting some
      sticks into the flame, she ran down to the river and jumped in. How
      delicious it was diving and swimming and floating in the dark forest,
      where the trees were so thick that you could hardly see the sun! But after
      a while she began to look about her, and her eyes fell on a little fish
      that seemed made out of a rainbow, so brilliant were the colours he
      flashed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like him for a pet,&rsquo; thought the girl, and the next time the
      fish swam by, she put out her hand and caught him. Then she ran along the
      grassy path till she came to a cave in front of which a stream fell over
      some rocks into a basin. Here she put her little fish, whose name was
      Djulung-djulung, and promising to return soon and bring him some dinner,
      she went away.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time she got home, the rice for their dinner was ready cooked, and
      the eldest sister gave the other six their portions in wooden bowls. But
      the youngest did not finish hers, and when no one was looking, stole off
      to the fountain in the forest where the little fish was swimming about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See! I have not forgotten you,&rsquo; she cried, and one by one she let the
      grains of rice fall into the water, where the fish gobbled them up
      greedily, for he had never tasted anything so nice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is all for to-day,&rsquo; she said at last, &lsquo;but I will come again
      to-morrow,&rsquo; and biding him good-bye she went down the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the girl did not tell her sisters about the fish, but every day she
      saved half of her rice to give him, and called him softly in a little song
      she had made for herself. If she sometimes felt hungry, no one knew of it,
      and, indeed, she did not mind that much, when she saw how the fish enjoyed
      it. And the fish grew fat and big, but the girl grew thin and weak, and
      the loads of wood felt heavier every day, and at last her sisters noticed
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they took counsel together, and watched her to see what she did, and
      one of them followed her to the fountain where Djulung lived, and saw her
      give him all the rice she had saved from her breakfast. Hastening home the
      sister told the others what she had witnessed, and that a lovely fat fish
      might be had for the catching. So the eldest sister went and caught him,
      and he was boiled for supper, but the youngest sister was away in the
      woods, and did not know anything about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning she went as usual to the cave, and sang her little song, but
      no Djulung came to answer it; twice and thrice she sang, then threw
      herself on her knees by the edge, and peered into the dark water, but the
      trees cast such a deep shadow that her eyes could not pierce it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Djulung cannot be dead, or his body would be floating on the surface,&rsquo; 
      she said to herself, and rising to her feet she set out homewards, feeling
      all of a sudden strangely tired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter with me?&rsquo; she thought, but somehow or other she
      managed to reach the hut, and threw herself down in a corner, where she
      slept so soundly that for days no one was able to wake her.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, one morning early, a cock began to crow so loud that she could
      sleep no longer and as he continued to crow she seemed to understand what
      he was saying, and that he was telling her that Djulung was dead, killed
      and eaten by her sisters, and that his bones lay buried under the kitchen
      fire. Very softly she got up, and took up the large stone under the fire,
      and creeping out carried the bones to the cave by the fountain, where she
      dug a hole and buried them anew. And as she scooped out the hole with a
      stick she sang a song, bidding the bones grow till they became a tree&mdash;a
      tree that reached up so high into the heavens that its leaves would fall
      across the sea into another island, whose king would pick them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there was no Djulung to give her rice to, the girl soon became fat
      again, and as she was able to do her work as of old, her sisters did not
      trouble about her. They never guessed that when she went into the forest
      to gather her sticks, she never failed to pay a visit to the tree, which
      grew taller and more wonderful day by day. Never was such a tree seen
      before. Its trunk was of iron, its leaves were of silk, its flowers of
      gold, and its fruit of diamonds, and one evening, though the girl did not
      know it, a soft breeze took one of the leaves, and blew it across the sea
      to the feet of one of the king&rsquo;s attendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a curious leaf! I have never beheld one like it before. I must show
      it to the king,&rsquo; he said, and when the king saw it he declared he would
      never rest until he had found the tree which bore it, even if he had to
      spend the rest of his life in visiting the islands that lay all round.
      Happily for him, he began with the island that was nearest, and here in
      the forest he suddenly saw standing before him the iron tree, its boughs
      covered with shining leaves like the one he carried about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what sort of a tree is it, and how did it get here?&rsquo; he asked of the
      attendants he had with him. No one could answer him, but as they were
      about to pass out of the forest a little boy went by, and the king stopped
      and inquired if there was anyone living in the neighbourhood whom he might
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seven girls live in a hut down there,&rsquo; replied the boy, pointing with his
      finger to where the sun was setting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then go and bring them here, and I will wait,&rsquo; said the king, and the boy
      ran off and told the sisters that a great chief, with strings of jewels
      round his neck, had sent for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pleased and excited the six elder sisters at once followed the boy, but
      the youngest, who was busy, and who did not care about strangers, stayed
      behind, to finish the work she was doing. The king welcomed the girls
      eagerly, and asked them all manner of questions about the tree, but as
      they had never even heard of its existence, they could tell him nothing.
      &lsquo;And if we, who live close by the forest, do not know, you may be sure no
      one does,&rsquo; added the eldest, who was rather cross at finding this was all
      that the king wanted of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But the boy told me there were seven of you, and there are only six
      here,&rsquo; said the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the youngest is at home, but she is always half asleep, and is of no
      use except to cut wood for the fire,&rsquo; replied they in a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That may be, but perhaps she dreams,&rsquo; answered the king. &lsquo;Anyway, I will
      speak to her also.&rsquo; Then he signed to one of his attendants, who followed
      the path that the boy had taken to the hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the man returned, with the girl walking behind him. And as soon as
      she reached the tree it bowed itself to the earth before her, and she
      stretched out her hand and picked some of its leaves and flowers and gave
      them to the king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The maiden who can work such wonders is fitted to be the wife of the
      greatest chief,&rsquo; he said, and so he married her, and took her with him
      across the sea to his own home, where they lived happily for ever after.

    <h2>
      The Sea King&rsquo;s Gift
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was once a fisherman who was called Salmon, and his Christian name
      was Matte. He lived by the shore of the big sea; where else could he live?
      He had a wife called Maie; could you find a better name for her? In winter
      they dwelt in a little cottage by the shore, but in spring they flitted to
      a red rock out in the sea and stayed there the whole summer until it was
      autumn. The cottage on the rock was even smaller than the other; it had a
      wooden bolt instead of an iron lock to the door, a stone hearth, a
      flagstaff, and a weather-cock on the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rock was called Ahtola, and was not larger than the market-place of a
      town. Between the crevices there grew a little rowan tree and four alder
      bushes. Heaven only knows how they ever came there; perhaps they were
      brought by the winter storms. Besides that, there flourished some tufts of
      velvety grass, some scattered reeds, two plants of the yellow herb called
      tansy, four of a red flower, and a pretty white one; but the treasures of
      the rock consisted of three roots of garlic, which Maie had put in a
      cleft. Rock walls sheltered them on the north side, and the sun shone on
      them on the south. This does not seem much, but it sufficed Maie for a
      herb plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      All good things go in threes, so Matte and his wife fished for salmon in
      spring, for herring in summer, and for cod in winter. When on Saturdays
      the weather was fine and the wind favourable, they sailed to the nearest
      town, sold their fish, and went to church on Sunday. But it often happened
      that for weeks at a time they were quite alone on the rock Ahtola, and had
      nothing to look at except their little yellow-brown dog, which bore the
      grand name of Prince, their grass tufts, their bushes and blooms, the sea
      bays and fish, a stormy sky and the blue, white-crested waves. For the
      rock lay far away from the land, and there were no green islets or human
      habitations for miles round, only here and there appeared a rock of the
      same red stone as Ahtola, besprinkled day and night with the ocean spray.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matte and Maie were industrious, hard-working folk, happy and contented in
      their poor hut, and they thought themselves rich when they were able to
      salt as many casks of fish as they required for winter and yet have some
      left over with which to buy tobacco for the old man, and a pound or two of
      coffee for his wife, with plenty of burned corn and chicory in it to give
      it a flavour. Besides that, they had bread, butter, fish, a beer cask, and
      a buttermilk jar; what more did they require? All would have gone well had
      not Maie been possessed with a secret longing which never let her rest;
      and this was, how she could manage to become the owner of a cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What would you do with a cow?&rsquo; asked Matte. &lsquo;She could not swim so far,
      and our boat is not large enough to bring her over here; and even if we
      had her, we have nothing to feed her on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have four alder bushes and sixteen tufts of grass,&rsquo; rejoined Maie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, of course,&rsquo; laughed Matte, &lsquo;and we have also three plants of garlic.
      Garlic would be fine feeding for her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every cow likes salt herring,&rsquo; rejoined his wife. &lsquo;Even Prince is fond of
      fish.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That may be,&rsquo; said her husband. &lsquo;Methinks she would soon be a dear cow if
      we had to feed her on salt herring. All very well for Prince, who fights
      with the gulls over the last morsel. Put the cow out of your head, mother,
      we are very well off as we are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maie sighed. She knew well that her husband was right, but she could not
      give up the idea of a cow. The buttermilk no longer tasted as good as
      usual in the coffee; she thought of sweet cream and fresh butter, and of
      how there was nothing in the world to be compared with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day as Matte and his wife were cleaning herring on the shore they
      heard Prince barking, and soon there appeared a gaily painted boat with
      three young men in it, steering towards the rock. They were students, on a
      boating excursion, and wanted to get something to eat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bring us a junket, good mother,&rsquo; cried they to Maie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! if only I had such a thing!&rsquo; sighed Maie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A can of fresh milk, then,&rsquo; said the students; &lsquo;but it must not be skim.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, if only I had it!&rsquo; sighed the old woman, still more deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! haven&rsquo;t you got a cow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maie was silent. This question so struck her to the heart that she could
      not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have no cow,&rsquo; Matte answered; &lsquo;but we have good smoked herring, and
      can cook them in a couple of hours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, then, that will do,&rsquo; said the students, as they flung
      themselves down on the rock, while fifty silvery-white herring were
      turning on the spit in front of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the name of this little stone in the middle of the ocean?&rsquo; asked
      one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ahtola,&rsquo; answered the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you should want for nothing when you live in the Sea King&rsquo;s
      dominion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Matte did not understand. He had never read Kalevala and knew nothing of
      the sea gods of old, but the students proceeded to explain to him.[FN#2:
      Kalevala is a collection of old Finnish songs about gods and heroes.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ahti,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;is a mighty king who lives in his dominion of Ahtola,
      and has a rock at the bottom of the sea, and possesses besides a treasury
      of good things. He rules over all fish and animals of the deep; he has the
      finest cows and the swiftest horses that ever chewed grass at the bottom
      of the ocean. He who stands well with Ahti is soon a rich man, but one
      must beware in dealing with him, for he is very changeful and touchy. Even
      a little stone thrown into the water might offend him, and then as he
      takes back his gift, he stirs up the sea into a storm and drags the
      sailors down into the depths. Ahti owns also the fairest maidens, who bear
      the train of his queen Wellamos, and at the sound of music they comb their
      long, flowing locks, which glisten in the water.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cried Matte, &lsquo;have your worships really seen all that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have as good as seen it,&rsquo; said the students. &lsquo;It is all printed in a
      book, and everything printed is true.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that,&rsquo; said Matte, as he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the herring were now ready, and the students ate enough for six, and
      gave Prince some cold meat which they happened to have in the boat. Prince
      sat on his hind legs with delight and mewed like a pussy cat. When all was
      finished, the students handed Matte a shining silver coin, and allowed him
      to fill his pipe with a special kind of tobacco. They then thanked him for
      his kind hospitality and went on their journey, much regretted by Prince,
      who sat with a woeful expression and whined on the shore as long as he
      could see a flip of the boat&rsquo;s white sail in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maie had never uttered a word, but thought the more. She had good ears,
      and had laid to heart the story about Ahti. &lsquo;How delightful,&rsquo; thought she
      to herself, &lsquo;to possess a fairy cow! How delicious every morning and
      evening to draw milk from it, and yet have no trouble about the feeding,
      and to keep a shelf near the window for dishes of milk and junkets! But
      this will never be my luck.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you thinking of?&rsquo; asked Matte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; said his wife; but all the time she was pondering over some
      magic rhymes she had heard in her childhood from an old lame man, which
      were supposed to bring luck in fishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What if I were to try?&rsquo; thought she.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this was Saturday, and on Saturday evenings Matte never set the
      herring-net, for he did not fish on Sunday. Towards evening, however, his
      wife said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us set the herring-net just this once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said her husband, &lsquo;it is a Saturday night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Last night was so stormy, and we caught so little,&rsquo; urged his wife;
      &lsquo;to-night the sea is like a mirror, and with the wind in this direction
      the herring are drawing towards land.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there are streaks in the north-western sky, and Prince was eating
      grass this evening,&rsquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely he has not eaten my garlic,&rsquo; exclaimed the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; but there will be rough weather by to-morrow at sunset,&rsquo; rejoined
      Matte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen to me,&rsquo; said his wife, &lsquo;we will set only one net close to the
      shore, and then we shall be able to finish up our half-filled cask, which
      will spoil if it stands open so long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man allowed himself to be talked over, and so they rowed out with
      the net. When they reached the deepest part of the water, she began to hum
      the words of the magic rhyme, altering the words to suit the longing of
      her heart:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          Oh, Ahti, with the long, long beard,
               Who dwellest in the deep blue sea,
          Finest treasures have I heard,
               And glittering fish belong to thee.
          The richest pearls beyond compare
               Are stored up in thy realm below,
          And Ocean&rsquo;s cows so sleek and fair
               Feed on the grass in thy green meadow.

          King of the waters, far and near,
               I ask not of thy golden store,
          I wish not jewels of pearl to wear,
               Nor silver either, ask I for,
          But one is odd and even is two,
               So give me a cow, sea-king so bold,
          And in return I&rsquo;ll give to you
               A slice of the moon, and the sun&rsquo;s gold.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re humming?&rsquo; asked the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, only the words of an old rhyme that keeps running in my head,&rsquo; 
      answered the old woman; and she raised her voice and went on:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          Oh, Ahti, with the long, long beard,
               Who dwellest in the deep blue sea,
          A thousand cows are in thy herd,
               I pray thee give one onto me.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a stupid sort of song,&rsquo; said Matte. &lsquo;What else should one beg of
      the sea-king but fish? But such songs are not for Sunday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife pretended not to hear him, and sang and sang the same tune all
      the time they were on the water. Matte heard nothing more as he sat and
      rowed the heavy boat, while thinking of his cracked pipe and the fine
      tobacco. Then they returned to the island, and soon after went to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      But neither Matte nor Maie could sleep a wink; the one thought of how he
      had profaned Sunday, and the other of Ahti&rsquo;s cow.
    </p>
    <p>
      About midnight the fisherman sat up, and said to his wife:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dost thou hear anything?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think the twirling of the weathercock on the roof bodes ill,&rsquo; said he;
      &lsquo;we shall have a storm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it is nothing but your fancy,&rsquo; said his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matte lay down, but soon rose again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The weathercock is squeaking now,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just fancy! Go to sleep,&rsquo; said his wife; and the old man tried to.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the third time he jumped out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ho! how the weather-cock is roaring at the pitch of its voice, as if it
      had a fire inside it! We are going to have a tempest, and must bring in
      the net.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Both rose. The summer night was as dark as if it had been October, the
      weather-cock creaked, and the storm was raging in every direction. As they
      went out the sea lay around them as white as now, and the spray was
      dashing right over the fisher-hut. In all his life Matte had never
      remembered such a night. To launch the boat and put to sea to rescue the
      net was a thing not to be thought of. The fisherman and his wife stood
      aghast on the doorstep, holding on fast by the doorpost, while the foam
      splashed over their faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did I not tell thee that there is no luck in Sunday fishing?&rsquo; said Matte
      sulkily; and his wife was so frightened that she never even once thought
      of Ahti&rsquo;s cows.
    </p>
    <p>
      As there was nothing to be done, they went in. Their eyes were heavy for
      lack of slumber, and they slept as soundly as if there had not been such a
      thing as an angry sea roaring furiously around their lonely dwelling. When
      they awoke, the sun was high in the heavens, the tempest had cased, and
      only the swell of the sea rose in silvery heavings against the red rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What can that be?&rsquo; said the old woman, as she peeped out of the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It looks like a big seal,&rsquo; said Matte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As sure as I live, it&rsquo;s a cow!&rsquo; exclaimed Maie. And certainly it was a
      cow, a fine red cow, fat and flourishing, and looking as if it had been
      fed all its days on spinach. It wandered peacefully up and down the shore,
      and never so much as even looked at the poor little tufts of grass, as if
      it despised such fare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matte could not believe his eyes. But a cow she seemed, and a cow she was
      found to be; and when the old woman began to milk her, every pitcher and
      pan, even to the baler, was soon filled with the most delicious milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man troubled his head in vain as to how she came there, and
      sallied forth to seek for his lost net. He had not proceeded far when he
      found it cast up on the shore, and so full of fish that not a mesh was
      visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is all very fine to possess a cow,&rsquo; said Matte, as he cleaned the
      fish; &lsquo;but what are we going to feed her on?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall find some means,&rsquo; said his wife; and the cow found the means
      herself. She went out and cropped the seaweed which grew in great
      abundance near the shore, and always kept in good condition. Every one
      Prince alone excepted, thought she was a clever beast; but Prince barked
      at her, for he had now got a rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day the red rock overflowed with milk and junkets, and every net
      was filled with fish. Matte and Maie grew fat on this fine living, and
      daily became richer. She churned quantities of butter, and he hired two
      men to help him in his fishing. The sea lay before him like a big fish
      tank, out of which he hauled as many as he required; and the cow continued
      to fend for herself. In autumn, when Matte and Maie went ashore, the cow
      went to sea, and in spring, when they returned to the rock, there she
      stood awaiting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall require a better house,&rsquo; said Maie the following summer; &lsquo;the
      old one is too small for ourselves and the men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Matte. So he built a large cottage, with a real lock to the
      door, and a store-house for fish as well; and he and his men caught such
      quantities of fish that they sent tons of salmon, herring, and cod to
      Russian and Sweden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am quite overworked with so many folk,&rsquo; said Maie; &lsquo;a girl to help me
      would not come amiss.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get one, then,&rsquo; said her husband; and so they hired a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Maie said: &lsquo;We have too little milk for all these folk. Now that I
      have a servant, with the same amount of trouble she could look after three
      cows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right, then,&rsquo; said her husband, somewhat provoked, &lsquo;you can sing a
      song to the fairies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This annoyed Maie, but nevertheless she rowed out to sea on Sunday night
      and sang as before:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          Oh, Ahti, with the long, long beard,
               Who dwellest in the deep blue sea,
          A thousand cows are in thy herd,
               I pray thee give three unto me.
</pre>
    <p>
      The following morning, instead of one, three cows stood on the island, and
      they all ate seaweed and fended for themselves like the first one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Art thou satisfied now?&rsquo; said Matte to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be quite satisfied,&rsquo; said his wife, &lsquo;if only I had two servants
      to help, and if I had some finer clothes. Don&rsquo;t you know that I am
      addressed as Madam?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said her husband. So Maie got several servants and clothes
      fit for a great lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everything would now be perfect if only we had a little better dwelling
      for summer. You might build us a two-storey house, and fetch soil to make
      a garden. Then you might make a little arbour up there to let us have a
      sea-view; and we might have a fiddler to fiddle to us of an evening, and a
      little steamer to take us to church in stormy weather.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anything more?&rsquo; asked Matte; but he did everything that his wife wished.
      The rock Ahtola became so grand and Maie so grand that all the sea-urchins
      and herring were lost in wonderment. Even Prince was fed on beefsteaks and
      cream scones till at last he was as round as a butter jar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you satisfied now?&rsquo; asked Matte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should be quite satisfied,&rsquo; said Maie, &lsquo;if only I had thirty cows. At
      least that number is required for such a household.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go to the fairies,&rsquo; said Matte.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife set out in the new steamer and sang to the sea-king. Next morning
      thirty cows stood on the shore, all finding food for themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Know&rsquo;st thou, good man, that we are far too cramped on this wretched
      rock, and where am I to find room for so many cows?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is nothing to be done but to pump out the sea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rubbish!&rsquo; said his wife. &lsquo;Who can pump out the sea?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Try with thy new steamer, there is a pump in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maie knew well that her husband was only making fun of her, but still her
      mind was set upon the same subject. &lsquo;I never could pump the sea out,&rsquo; 
      thought she, &lsquo;but perhaps I might fill it up, if I were to make a big dam.
      I might heap up sand and stones, and make our island as big again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maie loaded her boat with stones and went out to sea. The fiddler was with
      her, and fiddled so finely that Ahti and Wellamos and all the sea&rsquo;s
      daughters rose to the surface of the water to listen to the music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is that shining so brightly in the waves?&rsquo; asked Maie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is sea foam glinting in the sunshine,&rsquo; answered the fiddler.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Throw out the stones,&rsquo; said Maie.
    </p>
    <p>
      The people in the boat began to throw out the stones, splash, splash,
      right and left, into the foam. One stone hit the nose of Wellamos&rsquo;s chief
      lady-in-waiting, another scratched the sea queen herself on the cheek, a
      third plumped close to Ahti&rsquo;s head and tore off half of the sea-king&rsquo;s
      beard; then there was a commotion in the sea, the waves bubbled and
      bubbled like boiling water in a pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whence comes this gust of wind?&rsquo; said Maie; and as she spoke the sea
      opened and swallowed up the steamer. Maie sank to the bottom like a stone,
      but, stretching out her arms and legs, she rose to the surface, where she
      found the fiddler&rsquo;s fiddle, and used it as a float. At the same moment she
      saw close beside her the terrible head of Ahti, and he had only half a
      beard!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why did you throw stones at me?&rsquo; roared the sea-king.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, your majesty, it was a mistake! Put some bear&rsquo;s grease on your beard
      and that will soon make it grow again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dame, did I not give you all you asked for&mdash;nay, even more?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Truly, truly, your majesty. Many thanks for the cows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, where is the gold from the sun and the silver from the moon that
      you promised me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, your majesty, they have been scattered day and night upon the sea,
      except when the sky was overcast,&rsquo; slyly answered Maie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll teach you!&rsquo; roared the sea-king; and with that he gave the fiddle
      such a &lsquo;puff&rsquo; that it sent the old woman up like a sky-rocket on to her
      island. There Prince lay, as famished as ever, gnawing the carcase of a
      crow. There sat Matte in his ragged grey jacket, quite alone, on the steps
      of the old hut, mending a net.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heavens, mother,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;where are you coming from at such a whirlwind
      pace, and what makes you in such a dripping condition?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Maie looked around her amazed, and said, &lsquo;Where is our two-storey house?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What house?&rsquo; asked her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our big house, and the flower garden, and the men and the maids, and the
      thirty beautiful cows, and the steamer, and everything else?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are talking nonsense, mother,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;The students have quite
      turned your head, for you sang silly songs last evening while we were
      rowing, and then you could not sleep till early morning. We had stormy
      weather during the night, and when it was past I did not wish to waken
      you, so rowed out alone to rescue the net.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ve seen Ahti,&rsquo; rejoined Maie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been lying in bed, dreaming foolish fancies, mother, and then in
      your sleep you walked into the water.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But there is the fiddle,&rsquo; said Maie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A fine fiddle! It is only an old stick. No, no, old woman, another time
      we will be more careful. Good luck never attends fishing on a Sunday.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      The Raspberry Worm
    </h2>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Phew!&rsquo; cried Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ugh!&rsquo; cried Aina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What now?&rsquo; cried the big sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A worm!&rsquo; cried Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On the raspberry!&rsquo; cried Aina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kill it!&rsquo; cried Otto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a fuss over a poor little worm!&rsquo; said the big sister scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, when we had cleaned the raspberries so carefully,&rsquo; said Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It crept out from that very large one,&rsquo; put in Aina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And supposing someone had eaten the raspberry,&rsquo; said Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then they would have eaten the worm, too,&rsquo; said Aina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what harm?&rsquo; said Otto.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eat a worm!&rsquo; cried Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And kill him with one bite!&rsquo; murmured Aina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just think of it!&rsquo; said Otto laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now it is crawling on the table,&rsquo; cried Aina again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Blow it away!&rsquo; said the big sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tramp on it!&rsquo; laughed Otto.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lisa took a raspberry leaf, swept the worm carefully on to the leaf
      and carried it out into the yard. Then Aina noticed that a sparrow sitting
      on the fence was just ready to pounce on the poor little worm, so she took
      up the leaf, carried it out into the wood and hid it under a raspberry
      bush where the greedy sparrow could not find it. Yes, and what more is
      there to tell about a raspberry worm? Who would give three straws for such
      a miserable little thing? Yes, but who would not like to live in such a
      pretty home as it lives in; in such a fresh fragrant dark-red cottage, far
      away in the quiet wood among flowers and green leaves!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it was just dinner time, so they all had a dinner of raspberries and
      cream. &lsquo;Be careful with the sugar, Otto,&rsquo; said the big sister; but Otto&rsquo;s
      plate was like a snowdrift in winter, with just a little red under the
      snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after dinner the big sister said: &lsquo;Now we have eaten up the
      raspberries and we have none left to make preserve for the winter; it
      would be fine if we could get two baskets full of berries, then we could
      clean them this evening, and to-morrow we could cook them in the big
      preserving pan, and then we should have raspberry jam to eat on our
      bread!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, let us go to the wood and pick,&rsquo; said Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, let us,&rsquo; said Aina. &lsquo;You take the yellow basket and I will take the
      green one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t get lost, and come back safely in the evening,&rsquo; said the big
      sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Greetings to the raspberry worm,&rsquo; said Otto, mockingly. &lsquo;Next time I meet
      him I shall do him the honour of eating him up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So Aina and Lisa went off to the wood. Ah! how delightful it was there,
      how beautiful! It was certainly tiresome sometimes climbing over the
      fallen trees, and getting caught in the branches, and waging war with the
      juniper bushes and the midges, but what did that matter? The girls climbed
      well in their short dresses, and soon they were deep in the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were plenty of bilberries and elder berries, but no raspberries.
      They wandered on and on, and at last they came... No, it could not be
      true!... they came to a large raspberry wood. The wood had been on fire
      once, and now raspberry bushes had grown up, and there were raspberry
      bushes and raspberry bushes as far as the eye could see. Every bush was
      weighted to the ground with the largest, dark red, ripe raspberries, such
      a wealth of berries as two little berry pickers had never found before!
    </p>
    <p>
      Lisa picked, Aina picked. Lisa ate, Aina ate, and in a little while their
      baskets were full.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now we shall go home,&rsquo; said Aina. &lsquo;No, let us gather a few more,&rsquo; said
      Lisa. So they put the baskets down on the ground and began to fill their
      pinafores, and it was not long before their pinafores were full, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now we shall go home,&rsquo; said Lina. &lsquo;Yes, now we shall go home,&rsquo; said Aina.
      Both girls took a basket in one hand and held up her apron in the other
      and then turned to go home. But that was easier said than done. They had
      never been so far in the great wood before, they could not find any road
      nor path, and soon the girls noticed that they had lost their way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The worst of it was that the shadows of the tress were becoming so long in
      the evening sunlight, the birds were beginning to fly home, and the day
      was closing in. At last the sun went down behind the pine tops, and it was
      cool and dusky in the great wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls became anxious but went steadily on, expecting that the wood
      would soon end, and that they would see the smoke from the chimneys of
      their home.
    </p>
    <p>
      After they had wandered on for a long time it began to grow dark. At last
      they reached a great plain overgrown with bushes, and when they looked
      around them, they saw, as much as they could in the darkness, that they
      were among the same beautiful raspberry bushes from which they had picked
      their baskets and their aprons full. Then they were so tired that they sat
      down on a stone and began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am so hungry,&rsquo; said Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Aina, &lsquo;if we had only two good meat sandwiches now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she said that, she felt something in her hand, and when she looked
      down, she saw a large sandwich of bread and chicken, and at the same time
      Lisa said: &lsquo;How very queer! I have a sandwich in my hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I, too,&rsquo; said Aina. &lsquo;Will you dare to eat it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course I will,&rsquo; said Lisa. &lsquo;Ah, if we only had a good glass of milk
      now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as she said that she felt a large glass of milk between her fingers,
      and at the same time Aina cried out, &lsquo;Lisa! Lisa! I have a glass of milk
      in my hand! Isn&rsquo;t it queer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girls, however, were very hungry, so they ate and drank with a good
      appetite. When they had finished Aina yawned, stretched out her arms and
      said: &lsquo;Oh, if only we had a nice soft bed to sleep on now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had she spoken before she felt a nice soft bed by her side, and
      there beside Lisa was one too. This seemed to the girls more and more
      wonderful, but tired and sleepy as they were, they thought no more about
      it, but crept into the little beds, drew the coverlets over their heads
      and were soon asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they awoke the sun was high in the heavens, the wood was beautiful in
      the summer morning, and the birds were flying about in the branches and
      the tree tops.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the girls were filled with wonder when they saw that they had
      slept in the wood among the raspberry bushes. They looked at each other,
      they looked at their beds, which were of the finest flax covered over with
      leaves and moss. At last Lisa said: &lsquo;Are you awake, Aina?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Aina.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I am still dreaming,&rsquo; said Lisa.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Aina, &lsquo;but there is certainly some good fairy living among
      these raspberry bushes. Ah, if we had only a hot cup of coffee now, and a
      nice piece of white bread to dip into it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely had she finished speaking when she saw beside her a little silver
      tray with a gilt coffee-pot, two cups of rare porcelain, a sugar basin of
      fine crystal, silver sugar tongs, and some good fresh white bread. The
      girls poured out the beautiful coffee, put in the cream and sugar, and
      tasted it; never in their lives had they drunk such beautiful coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now I should like to know very much who has given us all this,&rsquo; said Lisa
      gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have, my little girls,&rsquo; said a voice just then from the bushes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children looked round wonderingly, and saw a little kind-looking old
      man, in a white coat and a red cap, limping out from among the bushes, for
      he was lame in his left foot; neither Lisa nor Aina could utter a word,
      they were so filled with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid, little girls,&rsquo; he said smiling kindly at them; he could
      not laugh properly because his mouth was crooked. &lsquo;Welcome to my kingdom!
      Have you slept well and eaten well and drunk well?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, indeed we have,&rsquo; said both the girls, &lsquo;but tell us...&rsquo; and they
      wanted to ask who the old man was, but were afraid to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will tell you who I am,&rsquo; said the old man; &lsquo;I am the raspberry king,
      who reigns over all this kingdom of raspberry bushes, and I have lived
      here for more than a thousand years. But the great spirit who rules over
      the woods, and the sea, and the sky, did not want me to become proud of my
      royal power and my long life. Therefore he decreed that one day in every
      hundred years I should change into a little raspberry worm, and live in
      that weak and helpless form from sunrise to sunset. During that time my
      life is dependent on the little worm&rsquo;s life, so that a bird can eat me, a
      child can pick me with the berries and trample under foot my thousand
      years of life. Now yesterday was just my transformation day, and I was
      taken with the raspberry and would have been trampled to death if you had
      not saved my life. Until sunset I lay helpless in the grass, and when I
      was swept away from your table I twisted one of my feet, and my mouth
      became crooked with terror; but when evening came and I could take my own
      form again, I looked for you to thank you and reward you. Then I found you
      both here in my kingdom, and tried to meet you both as well as I could
      without frightening you. Now I will send a bird from my wood to show you
      the way home. Good-bye, little children, thank you for your kind hearts;
      the raspberry king can show that he is not ungrateful.&rsquo; The children shook
      hands with the old man and thanked him, feeling very glad that they had
      saved the little raspberry worm. They were just going when the old man
      turned round, smiled mischievously with his crooked mouth, and said:
      &lsquo;Greetings to Otto from me, and tell him when I meet him again I shall do
      him the honour of eating him up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, please don&rsquo;t do that,&rsquo; cried both the girls, very frightened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, for your sake I will forgive him,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;I am not
      revengeful. Greetings to Otto and tell him that he may expect a gift from
      me, too. Good-bye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The two girls, light of heart, now took their berries and ran off through
      the wood after the bird; and soon it began to get lighter in the wood and
      they wondered how they could have lost their way yesterday, it seemed so
      easy and plain now.
    </p>
    <p>
      One can imagine what joy there was when the two reached home. Everyone had
      been looking for them, and the big sister had not been able to sleep, for
      she thought the wolves had eaten them up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Otto met them; he had a basket in his hand and said: &lsquo;Look, here is
      something that an old man has just left for you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When the girls looked into the basket they saw a pair of most beautiful
      bracelets of precious stones, dark red, and made in the shape of a ripe
      raspberry and with an inscription: &lsquo;To Lisa and Aina&rsquo;; beside them there
      was a diamond breast pin in the shape of a raspberry worm: on it was
      inscribed &lsquo;Otto, never destroy the helpless!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Otto felt rather ashamed: he quite understood what it meant, but he
      thought that the old man&rsquo;s revenge was a noble one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The raspberry king had also remembered the big sister, for when she went
      in to set the table for dinner, she found eleven big baskets of most
      beautiful raspberries, and no one knew how they had come there, but
      everyone guessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so there was such a jam-making as had never been seen before, and if
      you like to go and help in it, you might perhaps get a little, for they
      must surely be making jam still to this very day.

    <h2>
      The Stones of Plouhinec
    </h2>
    <p>
      Perhaps some of you may have read a book called &lsquo;Kenneth; or the
      Rear-Guard of the Grand Army&rsquo; of Napoleon. If so, you will remember how
      the two Scotch children found in Russia were taken care of by the French
      soldiers and prevented as far as possible from suffering from the horrors
      of the terrible Retreat. One of the soldiers, a Breton, often tried to
      make them forget how cold and hungry they were by telling them tales of
      his native country, Brittany, which is full of wonderful things. The best
      and warmest place round the camp fire was always given to the children,
      but even so the bitter frost would cause them to shiver. It was then that
      the Breton would begin: &lsquo;Plouhinec is a small town near Hennebonne by the
      sea,&rsquo; and would continue until Kenneth or Effie would interrupt him with
      an eager question. Then he forgot how his mother had told him the tale,
      and was obliged to begin all over again, so the story lasted a long while,
      and by the time it was ended the children were ready to be rolled up in
      what ever coverings could be found, and go to sleep. It is this story that
      I am going to tell to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Plouhinec is a small town near Hennebonne by the sea. Around it stretches
      a desolate moor, where no corn can be grown, and the grass is so coarse
      that no beast grows fat on it. Here and there are scattered groves of fir
      trees, and small pebbles are so thick on the ground that you might almost
      take it for a beach. On the further side, the fairies, or korigans, as the
      people called them, had set up long long ago two rows of huge stones;
      indeed, so tall and heavy were they, that it seemed as if all the fairies
      in the world could not have placed them upright.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far off them this great stone avenue, and on the banks of the little
      river Intel, there lived a man named Marzinne and his sister Rozennik.
      They always had enough black bread to eat, and wooden shoes or sabots to
      wear, and a pig to fatten, so the neighbours thought them quite rich; and
      what was still better, they thought themselves rich also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rozennik was a pretty girl, who knew how to make the best of everything,
      and she could, if she wished, have chosen a husband from the young men of
      Plouhinec, but she cared for none of them except Bernez, whom she had
      played with all her life, and Bernez, though he worked hard, was so very
      very poor that Marzinne told him roughly he must look elsewhere for a
      wife. But whatever Marzinne might say Rozennik smiled and nodded to him as
      before, and would often turn her head as she passed, and sing snatches of
      old songs over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christmas Eve had come, and all the men who worked under Marzinne or on
      the farms round about were gathered in the large kitchen to eat the soup
      flavoured with honey followed by rich puddings, to which they were always
      invited on this particular night. In the middle of the table was a large
      wooden bowl, with wooden spoons placed in a circle round it, so that each
      might dip in his turn. The benches were filled, and Marzinne was about to
      give the signal, when the door was suddenly thrown open, and an old man
      came in, wishing the guests a good appetite for their supper. There was a
      pause, and some of the faces looked a little frightened; for the new-comer
      was well known to them as a beggar, who was also said to be a wizard who
      cast spells over the cattle, and caused the corn to grow black, and old
      people to die, of what, nobody knew. Still, it was Christmas Eve, and
      besides it was as well not to offend him, so the farmer invited him in,
      and gave him a seat at the table and a wooden spoon like the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not much talk after the beggar&rsquo;s entrance, and everyone was glad
      when the meal came to an end, and the beggar asked if he might sleep in
      the stable, as he should die of cold if he were left outside. Rather
      unwillingly Marzinne gave him leave, and bade Bernez take the key and
      unlock the door. There was certainly plenty of room for a dozen beggars,
      for the only occupants of the stable were an old donkey and a thin ox; and
      as the night was bitter, the wizard lay down between them for warmth, with
      a sack of reeds for a pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had walked far that day, and even wizards get tired sometimes, so in
      spite of the hard floor he was just dropping off to sleep, when midnight
      struck from the church tower of Plouhinec. At this sound the donkey raised
      her head and shook her ears, and turned towards the ox.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, my dear cousin,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;and how have you fared since last
      Christmas Eve, when we had a conversation together?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of answering at once, the ox eyed the beggar with a long look of
      disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the use of talking,&rsquo; he replied roughly, &lsquo;when a good-for-nothing
      creature like that can hear all we say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you mustn&rsquo;t lose time in grumbling,&rsquo; rejoined the donkey gaily, &lsquo;and
      don&rsquo;t you see that the wizard is asleep?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His wicked pranks do not make him rich, certainly,&rsquo; said the ox, &lsquo;and he
      isn&rsquo;t even clever enough to have found out what a piece of luck might
      befall him a week hence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What piece of luck?&rsquo; asked the donkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, don&rsquo;t you know,&rsquo; inquired the ox, &lsquo;that once very hundred years the
      stones on Plouhinec heath go down to drink at the river, and that while
      they are away the treasures underneath them are uncovered?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, I remember now,&rsquo; replied the donkey, &lsquo;but the stones return so
      quickly to their places, that you certainly would be crushed to death
      unless you have in your hands a bunch of crowsfoot and of five-leaved
      trefoil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, but that is not enough,&rsquo; said the ox; &lsquo;even supposing you get safely
      by, the treasure you have brought with you will crumble into dust if you
      do not give in exchange a baptised soul. It is needful that a Christian
      should die before you can enjoy the wealth of Plouhinec.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The donkey was about to ask some further questions, when she suddenly
      found herself unable to speak: the time allowed them for conversation was
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, my dear creatures,&rsquo; thought the beggar, who had of course heard
      everything, &lsquo;you are going to make me richer than the richest men of
      Vannes or Lorient. But I have no time to lose; to-morrow I must begin to
      hunt for the precious plants.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not dare to seek too near Plouhinec, lest somebody who knew the
      story might guess what he was doing, so he went away further towards the
      south, where the air was softer and the plants are always green. From the
      instant it was light, till the last rays had faded out of the sky, he
      searched every inch of ground where the magic plants might grow; he
      scarcely gave himself a minute to eat and drink, but at length he found
      the crowsfoot in a little hollow! Well, that was certainly a great deal,
      but after all, the crowsfoot was of no use without the trefoil, and there
      was so little time left.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had almost give up hope, when on the very last day before it was
      necessary that he should start of Plouhinec, he came upon a little clump
      of trefoil, half hidden under a rock. Hardly able to breathe from
      excitement, he sat down and hunted eagerly through the plant which he had
      torn up. Leaf after leaf he threw aside in disgust, and he had nearly
      reached the end when he gave a cry of joy&mdash;the five-leaved trefoil
      was in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The beggar scrambled to his feet, and without a pause walked quickly down
      the road that led northwards. The moon was bright, and for some hours he
      kept steadily on, not knowing how many miles he had gone, nor even feeling
      tired. By and bye the sun rose, and the world began to stir, and stopping
      at a farmhouse door, he asked for a cup of milk and slice of bread and
      permission to rest for a while in the porch. Then he continued his
      journey, and so, towards sunset on New Year&rsquo;s Eve, he came back to
      Plouhinec.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he was passing the long line of stones, he saw Bernez working with a
      chisel on the tallest of them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you doing there?&rsquo; called the wizard, &lsquo;do you mean to hollow out
      for yourself a bed in that huge column?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Bernez quietly, &lsquo;but as I happened to have no work to do
      to-day, I thought I would just carve a cross on this stone. The holy sign
      can never come amiss.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe you think it will help you to win Rozennik,&rsquo; laughed the old
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bernez ceased his task for a moment to look at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, so you know about that,&rsquo; replied he; &lsquo;unluckily Marzinne wants a
      brother-in-law who has more pounds than I have pence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And suppose I were to give you more pounds than Marzinne ever dreamed
      of?&rsquo; whispered the sorcerer glancing round to make sure that no one
      overheard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what am I to do to gain the money,&rsquo; inquired Bernez, who knew quite
      well that the Breton peasant gives nothing for nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What I want of you only needs a little courage,&rsquo; answered the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If that is all, tell me what I have got to do, and I will do it,&rsquo; cried
      Bernez, letting fall his chisel. &lsquo;If I have to risk thirty deaths, I am
      ready.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When the beggar knew that Bernez would give him no trouble, he told him
      how, during that very night, the treasures under the stones would be
      uncovered, and how in a very few minutes they could take enough to make
      them both rich for life. But he kept silence as to the fate that awaited
      the man who was without the crowsfoot and the trefoil, and Bernez thought
      that nothing but boldness and quickness were necessary. So he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Old man, I am grateful, indeed, for the chance you have given me, and
      there will always be a pint of my blood at your service. Just let me
      finish carving this cross. It is nearly done, and I will join you in the
      fir wood at whatever hour you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must be there without fail an hour before midnight,&rsquo; answered the
      wizard, and went on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the hour struck from the great church at Plouhinec, Bernez entered the
      wood. He found the beggar already there with a bag in each hand, and a
      third slung round his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are punctual,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;but we need not start just yet. You
      had better sit down and think what you will do when your pockets are
      filled with gold and silver and jewels.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it won&rsquo;t take me long to plan out that,&rsquo; returned Bernez with a
      laugh. &lsquo;I shall give Rozennik everything she can desire, dresses of all
      sorts, from cotton to silk, and good things of all kinds to eat, from
      white bread to oranges.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The silver you find will pay for all that, and what about the gold?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With the gold I shall make rich Rozennik&rsquo;s relations and every friend of
      hers in the parish,&rsquo; replied he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So much for the gold; and the jewels?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; cried Bernez, &lsquo;I will divide the jewels amongst everybody in the
      world, so that they may be wealthy and happy; and I will tell them that it
      is Rozennik who would have it so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! it is close on midnight&mdash;we must go,&rsquo; whispered the wizard,
      and together they crept to the edge of the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the first stroke of twelve a great noise arose over the silent heath,
      and the earth seemed to rock under the feet of the two watchers. The next
      moment by the light of the moon they beheld the huge stones near them
      leave their places and go down the slope leading to the river, knocking
      against each other in their haste. Passing the spot where stood Bernez and
      the beggar, they were lost in the darkness. It seemed as if a procession
      of giants had gone by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quick,&rsquo; said the wizard, in a low voice, and he rushed towards the empty
      holes, which even in the night shone brightly from the treasures within
      them. Flinging himself on his knees, the old man began filling the wallets
      he had brought, listening intently all the time for the return of the
      stones up the hill, while Bernez more slowly put handfuls of all he could
      see into his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sorcerer had just closed his third wallet, and was beginning to wonder
      if he could carry away any more treasures when a low murmur as of a
      distant storm broke upon his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stones had finished drinking, and were hastening back to their places.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they came, bent a little forward, the tallest of them all at their
      head, breaking everything that stood in their way. At the sight Bernez
      stood transfixed with horror, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are lost! They will crush us to death.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not me!&rsquo; answered the sorcerer, holding up the crowsfoot and the
      five-leaved trefoil, &lsquo;for these will preserve me. But in order to keep my
      riches, I was obliged to sacrifice a Christian to the stones, and an evil
      fate threw you in my way.&rsquo; And as he spoke he stretched out the magic
      herbs to the stones, which were advancing rapidly. As if acknowledging a
      power greater than theirs, the monstrous things instantly parted to the
      right and left of the wizard, but closed their ranks again as they
      approached Bernez.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man did not try to escape, he knew it was useless, and sank on
      his knees and closed his eyes. But suddenly the tall stone that was
      leading stopped straight in front of Bernez, so that no other could get
      past.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the stone on which Bernez had carved the cross, and it was now a
      baptized stone, and had power to save him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the stone remained before the young man till the rest had taken their
      places, and then, darting like a bird to its own hole, came upon the
      beggar, who, thinking himself quite safe, was staggering along under the
      weight of his treasures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing the stone approaching, he held out the magic herbs which he
      carried, but the baptized stone was no longer subject to the spells that
      bound the rest, and passed straight on its way, leaving the wizard crushed
      into powder in the heather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Bernez went home, and showed his wealth to Marzinne, who this time
      did not refuse him as a brother-in-law, and he and Rozennik were married,
      and lived happy for ever after.

    <h2>
      The Castle of Kerglas
    </h2>
    <p>
      Peronnik was a poor idiot who belonged to nobody, and he would have died
      of starvation if it had not been for the kindness of the village people,
      who gave him food whenever he chose to ask for it. And as for a bed, when
      night came, and he grew sleepy, he looked about for a heap of straw, and
      making a hole in it, crept in, like a lizard. Idiot though he was, he was
      never unhappy, but always thanked gratefully those who fed him, and
      sometimes would stop for a little and sing to them. For he could imitate a
      lark so well, that no one knew which was Peronnik and which was the bird.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been wandering in a forest one day for several hours, and when
      evening approached, he suddenly felt very hungry. Luckily, just at that
      place the trees grew thinner, and he could see a small farmhouse a little
      way off. Peronnik went straight towards it, and found the farmer&rsquo;s wife
      standing at the door holding in her hands the large bowl out of which her
      children had eaten their supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am hungry, will you give me something to eat?&rsquo; asked the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you can find anything here, you are welcome to it,&rsquo; answered she, and,
      indeed, there was not much left, as everybody&rsquo;s spoon had dipped in. But
      Peronnik ate what was there with a hearty appetite, and thought that he
      had never tasted better food.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is made of the finest flour and mixed with the richest milk and
      stirred by the best cook in all the countryside,&rsquo; and though he said it to
      himself, the woman heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor innocent,&rsquo; she murmured, &lsquo;he does not know what he is saying, but I
      will cut him a slice of that new wheaten loaf,&rsquo; and so she did, and
      Peronnik ate up every crumb, and declared that nobody less than the
      bishop&rsquo;s baker could have baked it. This flattered the farmer&rsquo;s wife so
      much that she gave him some butter to spread on it, and Peronnik was still
      eating it on the doorstep when an armed knight rode up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can you tell me the way to the castle of Kerglas?&rsquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To Kerglas? are you really going to Kerglas?&rsquo; cried the woman, turning
      pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; and in order to get there I have come from a country so far off that
      it has taken me three months&rsquo; hard riding to travel as far as this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why do you want to go to Kerglas?&rsquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am seeking the basin of gold and the lance of diamonds which are in the
      castle,&rsquo; he answered. Then Peronnik looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The basin and the lance are very costly things,&rsquo; he said suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More costly and precious than all the crowns in the world,&rsquo; replied the
      stranger, &lsquo;for not only will the basin furnish you with the best food that
      you can dream of, but if you drink of it, it will cure you of any illness
      however dangerous, and will even bring the dead back to life, if it
      touches their mouths. As to the diamond lance, that will cut through any
      stone or metal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And to whom do these wonders belong?&rsquo; asked Peronnik in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To a magician named Rogear who lives in the castle,&rsquo; answered the woman.
      &lsquo;Every day he passes along here, mounted on a black mare, with a colt
      thirteen months old trotting behind. But no one dares to attack him, as he
      always carries his lance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is true,&rsquo; said the knight, &lsquo;but there is a spell laid upon him which
      forbids his using it within the castle of Kerglas. The moment he enters,
      the basin and lance are put away in a dark cellar which no key but one can
      open. And that is the place where I wish to fight the magician.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will never overcome him, Sir Knight,&rsquo; replied the woman, shaking her
      head. &lsquo;More than a hundred gentlemen have ridden past this house bent on
      the same errand, and not one has ever come back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know that, good woman,&rsquo; returned the knight, &lsquo;but then they did not
      have, like me, instructions from the hermit of Blavet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what did the hermit tell you?&rsquo; asked Peronnik.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He told me that I should have to pass through a wood full of all sorts of
      enchantments and voices, which would try to frighten me and make me lose
      my way. Most of those who have gone before me have wandered they know not
      where, and perished from cold, hunger, or fatigue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, suppose you get through safely?&rsquo; said the idiot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I do,&rsquo; continued the knight, &lsquo;I shall then meet a sort of fairy armed
      with a needle of fire which burns to ashes all it touches. This dwarf
      stands guarding an apple-tree, from which I am bound to pluck an apple.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And next?&rsquo; inquired Peronnik.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Next I shall find the flower that laughs, protected by a lion whose mane
      is formed of vipers. I must pluck that flower, and go on to the lake of
      the dragons and fight the black man who holds in his hand the iron ball
      which never misses its mark and returns of its own accord to its master.
      After that, I enter the valley of pleasure, where some who conquered all
      the other obstacles have left their bones. If I can win through this, I
      shall reach a river with only one ford, where a lady in black will be
      seated. She will mount my horse behind me, and tell me what I am to do
      next.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and the woman shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will never be able to do all that,&rsquo; said she, but he bade her
      remembered that these were only matters for men, and galloped away down
      the path she pointed out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmer&rsquo;s wife sighed and, giving Peronnik some more food, bade him
      good-night. The idiot rose and was opening the gate which led into the
      forest when the farmer himself came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want a boy to tend my cattle,&rsquo; he said abruptly, &lsquo;as the one I had has
      run away. Will you stay and do it?&rsquo; and Peronnik, though he loved his
      liberty and hated work, recollected the good food he had eaten, and agreed
      to stop.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sunrise he collected his herd carefully and led them to the rich
      pasture which lay along the borders of the forest, cutting himself a hazel
      wand with which to keep them in order.
    </p>
    <p>
      His task was not quite so easy as it looked, for the cows had a way of
      straying into the wood, and by the time he had brought one back another
      was off. He had gone some distance into the trees, after a naughty black
      cow which gave him more trouble than all the rest, when he heard the noise
      of horse&rsquo;s feet, and peeping through the leaves he beheld the giant Rogear
      seated on his mare, with the colt trotting behind. Round the giant&rsquo;s neck
      hung the golden bowl suspended from a chain, and in his hand he grasped
      the diamond lance, which gleamed like fire. But as soon as he was out of
      sight the idiot sought in vain for traces of the path he had taken.
    </p>
    <p>
      This happened not only once but many times, till Peronnik grew so used to
      him that he never troubled to hide. But on each occasion he saw him the
      desire to possess the bowl and the lance became stronger.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening the boy was sitting alone on the edge of the forest, when a
      man with a white beard stopped beside him. &lsquo;Do you want to know the way to
      Kerglas?&rsquo; asked the idiot, and the man answered &lsquo;I know it well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have been there without being killed by the magician?&rsquo; cried
      Peronnik.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! he had nothing to fear from me,&rsquo; replied the white-bearded man, &lsquo;I am
      Rogear&rsquo;s elder brother, the wizard Bryak. When I wish to visit him I
      always pass this way, and as even I cannot go through the enchanted wood
      without losing myself, I call the colt to guide me.&rsquo; Stooping down as he
      spoke he traced three circles on the ground and murmured some words very
      low, which Peronnik could not hear. Then he added aloud:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
         Colt, free to run and free to eat.
         Colt, gallop fast until we meet,
</pre>
    <p>
      and instantly the colt appeared, frisking and jumping to the wizard, who
      threw a halter over his neck and leapt on his back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peronnik kept silence at the farm about this adventure, but he understood
      very well that if he was ever to get to Kerglas he must first catch the
      colt which knew the way. Unhappily he had not heard the magic words
      uttered by the wizard, and he could not manage to draw the three circles,
      so if he was to summon the colt at all he must invent some other means of
      doing it.
    </p>
    <p>
      All day long, while he was herding the cows, he thought and thought how he
      was to call the colt, for he felt sure that once on its back he could
      overcome the other dangers. Meantime he must be ready in case a chance
      should come, and he made his preparations at night, when everyone was
      asleep. Remembering what he had seen the wizard do, he patched up an old
      halter that was hanging in a corner of the stable, twisted a rope of hemp
      to catch the colt&rsquo;s feet, and a net such as is used for snaring birds.
      Next he sewed roughly together some bits of cloth to serve as a pocket,
      and this he filled with glue and lark&rsquo;s feathers, a string of beads, a
      whistle of elder wood, and a slice of bread rubbed over with bacon fat.
      Then he went out to the path down which Rogear, his mare, and the colt
      always rode, and crumbled the bread on one side of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Punctual to their hour all three appeared, eagerly watched by Peronnik,
      who lay hid in the bushes close by. Suppose it was useless; suppose the
      mare, and not the colt, ate the crumbs? Suppose&mdash;but no! the mare and
      her rider went safely by, vanishing round a corner, while the colt,
      trotting along with its head on the ground, smelt the bread, and began
      greedily to lick up the pieces. Oh, how good it was! Why had no one ever
      given it that before, and so absorbed was the little beast, sniffing about
      after a few more crumbs, that it never heard Peronnik creep up till it
      felt the halter on its neck and the rope round its feet, and&mdash;in
      another moment&mdash;some one on its back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Going as fast as the hobbles would allow, the colt turned into one of the
      wildest parts of the forest, while its rider sat trembling at the strange
      sights he saw. Sometimes the earth seemed to open in front of them and he
      was looking into a bottomless pit; sometimes the trees burst into flames
      and he found himself in the midst of a fire; often in the act of crossing
      a stream the water rose and threatened to sweep him away; and again, at
      the foot of a mountain, great rocks would roll towards him, as if they
      would crush him and his colt beneath their weight. To his dying day
      Peronnik never knew whether these things were real or if he only imagined
      them, but he pulled down his knitted cap so as to cover his eyes, and
      trusted the colt to carry him down the right road.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the forest was left behind, and they came out on a wide plain
      where the air blew fresh and strong. The idiot ventured to peep out, and
      found to his relief that the enchantments seemed to have ended, though a
      thrill of horror shot through him as he noticed the skeletons of men
      scattered over the plain, beside the skeletons of their horses. And what
      were those grey forms trotting away in the distance? Were they&mdash;could
      they be&mdash;wolves?
    </p>
    <p>
      But vast through the plain seemed, it did not take long to cross, and very
      soon the colt entered a sort of shady park in which was standing a single
      apple-tree, its branches bowed down to the ground with the weight of its
      fruit. In front was the korigan&mdash;the little fairy man&mdash;holding
      in his hand the fiery sword, which reduced to ashes everything it touched.
      At the sight of Peronnik he uttered a piercing scream, and raised his
      sword, but without appearing surprised the youth only lifted his cap,
      though he took care to remain at a little distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not be alarmed, my prince,&rsquo; said Peronnik, &lsquo;I am just on my way to
      Kerglas, as the noble Rogear has begged me to come to him on business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Begged you to come!&rsquo; repeated the dwarf, &lsquo;and who, then, are you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am the new servant he has engaged, as you know very well,&rsquo; answered
      Peronnik.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not know at all,&rsquo; rejoined the korigan sulkily, &lsquo;and you may be a
      robber for all I can tell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am so sorry,&rsquo; replied Peronnik, &lsquo;but I may be wrong in calling myself a
      servant, for I am only a bird-catcher. But do not delay me, I pray, for
      his highness the magician expects me, and, as you see, has lent me his
      colt so that I may reach the castle all the quicker.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words the korigan cast his eyes for the first time on the colt,
      which he knew to be the one belonging to the magician, and began to think
      that the young man was speaking the truth. After examining the horse, he
      studied the rider, who had such an innocent, and indeed vacant, air that
      he appeared incapable of inventing a story. Still, the dwarf did not feel
      quite sure that all was right, and asked what the magician wanted with a
      bird-catcher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From what he says, he wants one very badly,&rsquo; replied Peronnik, &lsquo;as he
      declares that all his grain and all the fruit in his garden at Kerglas are
      eaten up by the birds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how are you going to stop that, my fine fellow?&rsquo; inquired the
      korigan; and Peronnik showed him the snare he had prepared, and remarked
      that no bird could possible escape from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is just what I should like to be sure of,&rsquo; answered the korigan. &lsquo;My
      apples are completely eaten up by blackbirds and thrushes. Lay your snare,
      and if you can manage to catch them, I will let you pass.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is a fair bargain,&rsquo; and as he spoke Peronnik jumped down and
      fastened his colt to a tree; then, stopping, he fixed one end of the net
      to the trunk of the apple tree, and called to the korigan to hold the
      other while he took out the pegs. The dwarf did as he was bid, when
      suddenly Peronnik threw the noose over his neck and drew it close, and the
      korigan was held as fast as any of the birds he wished to snare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shrieking with rage, he tried to undo the cord, but he only pulled the
      knot tighter. He had put down the sword on the grass, and Peronnik had
      been careful to fix the net on the other side of the tree, so that it was
      now easy for him to pluck an apple and to mount his horse, without being
      hindered by the dwarf, whom he left to his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had left the plain behind them, Peronnik and his steed found
      themselves in a narrow valley in which was a grove of trees, full of all
      sorts of sweet-smelling things&mdash;roses of every colour, yellow broom,
      pink honeysuckle&mdash;while above them all towered a wonderful scarlet
      pansy whose face bore a strange expression. This was the flower that
      laughs, and no one who looked at it could help laughing too. Peronnik&rsquo;s
      heart beat high at the thought that he had reached safely the second
      trial, and he gazed quite calmly at the lion with the mane of vipers
      twisting and twirling, who walked up and down in front of the grove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man pulled up and removed his cap, for, idiot though he was, he
      knew that when you have to do with people greater than yourself, a cap is
      more useful in the hand than on the head. Then, after wishing all kinds of
      good fortune to the lion and his family, he inquired if he was on the
      right road to Kerglas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what is your business at Kerglas?&rsquo; asked the lion with a growl, and
      showing his teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With all respect,&rsquo; answered Peronnik, pretending to be very frightened,
      &lsquo;I am the servant of a lady who is a friend of the noble Rogear and sends
      him some larks for a pasty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Larks?&rsquo; cried the lion, licking his long whiskers. &lsquo;Why, it must be a
      century since I have had any! Have you a large quantity with you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As many as this bag will hold,&rsquo; replied Peronnik, opening, as he spoke,
      the bag which he had filled with feathers and glue; and to prove what he
      said, he turned his back on the lion and began to imitate the song of a
      lark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; exclaimed the lion, whose mouth watered, &lsquo;show me the birds! I
      should like to see if they are fat enough for my master.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would do it with pleasure,&rsquo; answered the idiot, &lsquo;but if I once open the
      bag they will all fly away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, open it wide enough for me to look in,&rsquo; said the lion, drawing a
      little nearer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this was just what Peronnik had been hoping for, so he held the bag
      while the lion opened it carefully and put his head right inside, so that
      he might get a good mouthful of larks. But the mass of feathers and glue
      stuck to him, and before he could pull his head out again Peronnik had
      drawn tight the cord, and tied it in a knot that no man could untie. Then,
      quickly gathering the flower that laughs, he rode off as fast as the colt
      could take him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The path soon led to the lake of the dragons, which he had to swim across.
      The colt, who was accustomed to it, plunged into the water without
      hesitation; but as soon as the dragons caught sight of Peronnik they
      approached from all parts of the lake in order to devour him.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Peronnik did not trouble to take off his cap, but he threw the
      beads he carried with him into the water, as you throw black corn to a
      duck, and with each bead that he swallowed a dragon turned on his back and
      died, so that the idiot reached the other side without further trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The valley guarded by the black man now lay before him, and from afar
      Peronnik beheld him, chained by one foot to a rock at the entrance, and
      holding the iron ball which never missed its mark and always returned to
      its master&rsquo;s hand. In his head the black man had six eyes that were never
      all shut at once, but kept watch one after the other. At this moment they
      were all open, and Peronnik knew well that if the black man caught a
      glimpse of him he would cast his ball. So, hiding the colt behind a
      thicket of bushes, he crawled along a ditch and crouched close to the very
      rock to which the black man was chained.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was hot, and after a while the man began to grow sleepy. Two of
      his eyes closed, and Peronnik sang gently. In a moment a third eye shut,
      and Peronnik sang on. The lid of a fourth eye dropped heavily, and then
      those of the fifth and the sixth. The black man was asleep altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, on tiptoe, the idiot crept back to the colt which he led over soft
      moss past the black man into the vale of pleasure, a delicious garden full
      of fruits that dangled before your mouth, fountains running with wine, and
      flowers chanting in soft little voices. Further on, tables were spread
      with food, and girls dancing on the grass called to him to join them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peronnik heard, and, scarcely knowing what he did drew the colt into a
      slower pace. He sniffed greedily the smell of the dishes, and raised his
      head the better to see the dancers. Another instant and he would have
      stopped altogether and been lost, like others before him, when suddenly
      there came to him like a vision the golden bowl and the diamond lance.
      Drawing his whistle from his pocket, he blew it loudly, so as to drown the
      sweet sounds about him, and ate what was left of his bread and bacon to
      still the craving of the magic fruits. His eyes he fixed steadily on the
      ears of the colt, that he might not see the dancers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way he was able to reach the end of the garden, and at length
      perceived the castle of Kerglas, with the river between them which had
      only one ford. Would the lady be there, as the old man had told him? Yes,
      surely that was she, sitting on a rock, in a black satin dress, and her
      face the colour of a Moorish woman&rsquo;s. The idiot rode up, and took off his
      cap more politely than ever, and asked if she did not wish to cross the
      river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was waiting for you to help me do so,&rsquo; answered she. &lsquo;Come near, that I
      may get up behind you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Peronnik did as she bade him, and by the help of his arm she jumped nimbly
      on to the back of the colt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know how to kill the magician?&rsquo; asked the lady, as they were
      crossing the ford.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought that, being a magician, he was immortal, and that no one could
      kill him,&rsquo; replied Peronnik.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Persuade him to taste that apple, and he will die, and if that is not
      enough I will touch him with my finger, for I am the plague,&rsquo; answered
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But if I kill him, how am I to get the golden bowl and the diamond lance
      that are hidden in the cellar without a key?&rsquo; rejoined Peronnik.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The flower that laughs opens all doors and lightens all darkness,&rsquo; said
      the lady; and as she spoke, they reached the further bank, and advanced
      towards the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of the entrance was a sort of tent supported on poles, and under
      it the giant was sitting, basking in the sun. As soon as he noticed the
      colt bearing Peronnik and the lady, he lifted his head, and cried in a
      voice of thunder:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it is surely the idiot, riding my colt thirteen months old!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Greatest of magicians, you are right,&rsquo; answered Peronnik.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how did you manage to catch him?&rsquo; asked the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By repeating what I learnt from your brother Bryak on the edge of the
      forest,&rsquo; replied the idiot. &lsquo;I just said&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          Colt, free to run and free to eat,
          Colt, gallop fast until we meet,
</pre>
    <p>
      and it came directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know my brother, then?&rsquo; inquired the giant. &lsquo;Tell me why he sent you
      here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To bring you two gifts which he has just received from the country of the
      Moors,&rsquo; answered Peronnik: &lsquo;the apple of delight and the woman of
      submission. If you eat the apple you will not desire anything else, and if
      you take the woman as your servant you will never wish for another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, give me the apple, and bid the woman get down,&rsquo; answered Rogear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idiot obeyed, but at the first taste of the apple the giant staggered,
      and as the long yellow finger of the woman touched him he fell dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the magician where he lay, Peronnik entered the palace, bearing
      with him the flower that laughs. Fifty doors flew open before him, and at
      length he reached a long flight of steps which seemed to lead into the
      bowels of the earth. Down these he went till he came to a silver door
      without a bar or key. Then he held up high the flower that laughs, and the
      door slowly swung back, displaying a deep cavern, which was as bright as
      the day from the shining of the golden bowl and the diamond lance. The
      idiot hastily ran forward and hung the bowl round his neck from the chain
      which was attached to it, and took the lance in his hand. As he did so,
      the ground shook beneath him, and with an awful rumbling the palace
      disappeared, and Peronnik found himself standing close to the forest where
      he led the cattle to graze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though darkness was coming on, Peronnik never thought of entering the
      farm, but followed the road which led to the court of the duke of
      Brittany. As he passed through the town of Vannes he stopped at a tailor&rsquo;s
      shop, and bought a beautiful costume of brown velvet and a white horse,
      which he paid for with a handful of gold that he had picked up in the
      corridor of the castle of Kerglas. Thus he made his way to the city of
      Nantes, which at that moment was besieged by the French.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little way off, Peronnik stopped and looked about him. For miles round
      the country was bare, for the enemy had cut down every tree and burnt
      every blade of corn; and, idiot though he might be, Peronnik was able to
      grasp that inside the gates men were dying of famine. He was still gazing
      with horror, when a trumpeter appeared on the walls, and, after blowing a
      loud blast, announced that the duke would adopt as his heir the man who
      could drive the French out of the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the four sides of the city the trumpeter blew his blast, and the last
      time Peronnik, who had ridden up as close as he might, answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You need blow no more,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;for I myself will free the town from
      her enemies.&rsquo; And turning to a soldier who came running up, waving his
      sword, he touched him with the magic lance, and he fell dead on the spot.
      The men who were following stood still, amazed. Their comrade&rsquo;s armour had
      not been pierced, of that they were sure, yet he was dead, as if he had
      been struck to the heart. But before they had time to recover from their
      astonishment, Peronnik cried out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see how my foes will fare; now behold what I can do for my friends,&rsquo; 
      and, stooping down, he laid the golden bowl against the mouth of the
      soldier, who sat up as well as ever. Then, jumping his horse across the
      trench, he entered the gate of the city, which had opened wide enough to
      receive him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The news of these marvels quickly spread through the town, and put fresh
      spirit into the garrison, so that they declared themselves able to fight
      under the command of the young stranger. And as the bowl restored all the
      dead Bretons to life, Peronnik soon had an army large enough to drive away
      the French, and fulfilled his promise of delivering his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the bowl and the lance, no one knows what became of them, but some
      say that Bryak the sorcerer managed to steal them again, and that any one
      who wishes to possess them must seek them as Peronnik did.

    <h2>
      The Battle of the Birds
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was to be a great battle between all the creatures of the earth and
      the birds of the air. News of it went abroad, and the son of the king of
      Tethertown said that when the battle was fought he would be there to see
      it, and would bring back word who was to be king. But in spite of that, he
      was almost too late, and every fight had been fought save the last, which
      was between a snake and a great black raven. Both struck hard, but in the
      end the snake proved the stronger, and would have twisted himself round
      the neck of the raven till he died had not the king&rsquo;s son drawn his sword,
      and cut off the head of the snake at a single blow. And when the raven
      beheld that his enemy was dead, he was grateful, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For thy kindness to me this day, I will show thee a sight. So come up now
      on the root of my two wings.&rsquo; The king&rsquo;s son did as he was bid, and before
      the raven stopped flying, they had passed over seven bens and seven glens
      and seven mountain moors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you see that house yonder?&rsquo; said the raven at last. &lsquo;Go straight for
      it, for a sister of mine dwells there, and she will make you right
      welcome. And if she asks, &ldquo;Wert thou at the battle of the birds?&rdquo; answer
      that thou wert, and if she asks, &ldquo;Didst thou see my likeness?&rdquo; answer that
      thou sawest it, but be sure thou meetest me in the morning at this place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The king&rsquo;s son followed what the raven told him and that night he had meat
      of each meat, and drink of each drink, warm water for his feet, and a soft
      bed to lie in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it happened the next day, and the next, but on the fourth meeting,
      instead of meeting the raven, in his place the king&rsquo;s son found waiting
      for him the handsomest youth that ever was seen, with a bundle in his
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there a raven hereabouts?&rsquo; asked the king&rsquo;s son, and the youth
      answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am that raven, and I was delivered by thee from the spells that bound
      me, and in reward thou wilt get this bundle. Go back by the road thou
      camest, and lie as before, a night in each house, but be careful not to
      unloose the bundle till thou art in the place wherein thou wouldst most
      wish to dwell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the king&rsquo;s son set out, and thus it happened as it had happened
      before, till he entered a thick wood near his father&rsquo;s house. He had
      walked a long way and suddenly the bundle seemed to grow heavier; first he
      put it down under a tree, and next he thought he would look at it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The string was easy to untie, and the king&rsquo;s son soon unfastened the
      bundle. What was it he saw there? Why, a great castle with an orchard all
      about it, and in the orchard fruit and flowers and birds of very kind. It
      was all ready for him to dwell in, but instead of being in the midst of
      the forest, he did wish he had left the bundle unloosed till he had
      reached the green valley close to his father&rsquo;s palace. Well, it was no use
      wishing, and with a sigh he glanced up, and beheld a huge giant coming
      towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bad is the place where thou hast built thy house, king&rsquo;s son,&rsquo; said the
      giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True; it is not here that I wish to be,&rsquo; answered the king&rsquo;s son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What reward wilt thou give me if I put it back in the bundle?&rsquo; asked the
      giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What reward dost thou ask?&rsquo; answered the king&rsquo;s son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The first boy thou hast when he is seven years old,&rsquo; said the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I have a boy thou shalt get him,&rsquo; answered the king&rsquo;s son, and as he
      spoke the castle and the orchard were tied up in the bundle again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now take thy road, and I will take mine,&rsquo; said the giant. &lsquo;And if thou
      forgettest thy promise, I will remember it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Light of heart the king&rsquo;s son went on his road, till he came to the green
      valley near his father&rsquo;s palace. Slowly he unloosed the bundle, fearing
      lest he should find nothing but a heap of stones or rags. But no! all was
      as it had been before, and as he opened the castle door there stood within
      the most beautiful maiden that ever was seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Enter, king&rsquo;s son,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;all is ready, and we will be married at
      once,&rsquo; and so they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      The maiden proved a good wife, and the king&rsquo;s son, now himself a king, was
      so happy that he forgot all about the giant. Seven years and a day had
      gone by, when one morning, while standing on the ramparts, he beheld the
      giant striding towards the castle. Then he remembered his promise, and
      remembered, too, that he had told the queen nothing about it. Now he must
      tell her, and perhaps she might help him in his trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The queen listened in silence to his tale, and after he had finished, she
      only said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave thou the matter between me and the giant,&rsquo; and as she spoke, the
      giant entered the hall and stood before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bring out your son,&rsquo; cried he to the king, &lsquo;as you promised me seven
      years and a day since.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The king glanced at his wife, who nodded, so he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let his mother first put him in order,&rsquo; and the queen left the hall, and
      took the cook&rsquo;s son and dressed him in the prince&rsquo;s clothes, and led him
      up to the giant, who held his hand, and together they went out along the
      road. They had not walked far when the giant stopped and stretched out a
      stick to the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If your father had that stick, what would he do with it?&rsquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If my father had that stick, he would beat the dogs and cats that steal
      the king&rsquo;s meat,&rsquo; replied the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou art the cook&rsquo;s son!&rsquo; cried the giant. &lsquo;Go home to thy mother&rsquo;; and
      turning his back he strode straight to the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you seek to trick me this time, the highest stone will soon be the
      lowest,&rsquo; said he, and the king and queen trembled, but they could not bear
      to give up their boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The butler&rsquo;s son is the same age as ours,&rsquo; whispered the queen; &lsquo;he will
      not know the difference,&rsquo; and she took the child and dressed him in the
      prince&rsquo;s clothes, and the giant let him away along the road. Before they
      had gone far he stopped, and held out a stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If thy father had that rod, what would he do with it?&rsquo; asked the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He would beat the dogs and cats that break the king&rsquo;s glasses,&rsquo; answered
      the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou art the son of the butler!&rsquo; cried the giant. &lsquo;Go home to thy
      mother&rsquo;; and turning round he strode back angrily to the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bring out thy son at once,&rsquo; roared he, &lsquo;or the stone that is highest will
      be lowest,&rsquo; and this time the real prince was brought.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though his parents wept bitterly and fancied the child was suffering
      all kinds of dreadful things, the giant treated him like his own son,
      though he never allowed him to see his daughters. The boy grew to be a big
      boy, and one day the giant told him that he would have to amuse himself
      alone for many hours, as he had a journey to make. So the boy wandered to
      the top of the castle, where he had never been before. There he paused,
      for the sound of music broke upon his ears, and opening a door near him,
      he beheld a girl sitting by the window, holding a harp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Haste and begone, I see the giant close at hand,&rsquo; she whispered
      hurriedly, &lsquo;but when he is asleep, return hither, for I would speak with
      thee.&rsquo; And the prince did as he was bid, and when midnight struck he crept
      back to the top of the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow,&rsquo; said the girl, who was the giant&rsquo;s daughter, &lsquo;to-morrow thou
      wilt get the choice of my two sisters to marry, but thou must answer that
      thou wilt not take either, but only me. This will anger him greatly, for
      he wishes to betroth me to the son of the king of the Green City, whom I
      like not at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they parted, and on the morrow, as the girl had said, the giant
      called his three daughters to him, and likewise the young prince to whom
      he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, O son of the king of Tethertown, the time has come for us to part.
      Choose one of my two elder daughters to wife, and thou shalt take her to
      your father&rsquo;s house the day after the wedding.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me the youngest instead,&rsquo; replied the youth, and the giant&rsquo;s face
      darkened as he heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three things must thou do first,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say on, I will do them,&rsquo; replied the prince, and the giant left the
      house, and bade him follow to the byre, where the cows were kept.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For a hundred years no man has swept this byre,&rsquo; said the giant, &lsquo;but if
      by nightfall, when I reach home, thou has not cleaned it so that a golden
      apple can roll through it from end to end, thy blood shall pay for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      All day long the youth toiled, but he might as well have tried to empty
      the ocean. At length, when he was so tired he could hardly move, the
      giant&rsquo;s youngest daughter stood in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lay down thy weariness,&rsquo; said she, and the king&rsquo;s son, thinking he could
      only die once, sank on the floor at her bidding, and fell sound asleep.
      When he woke the girl had disappeared, and the byre was so clean that a
      golden apple could roll from end to end of it. He jumped up in surprise,
      and at that moment in came the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hast thou cleaned the byre, king&rsquo;s son?&rsquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have cleaned it,&rsquo; answered he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, since thou wert so active to-day, to-morrow thou wilt thatch this
      byre with a feather from every different bird, or else thy blood shall pay
      for it,&rsquo; and he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the sun was up, the youth took his bow and his quiver and set off
      to kill the birds. Off to the moor he went, but never a bird was to be
      seen that day. At last he got so tired with running to and fro that he
      gave up heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is but one death I can die,&rsquo; thought he. Then at midday came the
      giant&rsquo;s daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou art tired, king&rsquo;s son?&rsquo; asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am,&rsquo; answered he; &lsquo;all these hours have I wandered, and there fell but
      these two blackbirds, both of one colour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lay down thy weariness on the grass,&rsquo; said she, and he did as she bade
      him, and fell fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he woke the girl had disappeared, and he got up, and returned to the
      byre. As he drew near, he rubbed his eyes hard, thinking he was dreaming,
      for there it was, beautifully thatched, just as the giant had wished. At
      the door of the house he met the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hast thou thatched the byre, king&rsquo;s son?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have thatched it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, since thou hast been so active to-day, I have something else for
      thee! Beside the loch thou seest over yonder there grows a fir tree. On
      the top of the fir tree is a magpie&rsquo;s nest, and in the nest are five eggs.
      Thou wilt bring me those eggs for breakfast, and if one is cracked or
      broken, thy blood shall pay for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before it was light next day, the king&rsquo;s son jumped out of bed and ran
      down to the loch. The tree was not hard to find, for the rising sun shone
      red on the trunk, which was five hundred feet from the ground to its first
      branch. Time after time he walked round it, trying to find some knots,
      however small, where he could put his feet, but the bark was quite smooth,
      and he soon saw that if he was to reach the top at all, it must be by
      climbing up with his knees like a sailor. But then he was a king&rsquo;s son and
      not a sailor, which made all the difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, it was no use standing there staring at the fir, at least he must
      try to do his best, and try he did till his hands and knees were sore, for
      as soon as he had struggled up a few feet, he slid back again. Once he
      climbed a little higher than before, and hope rose in his heart, then down
      he came with such force that his hands and knees smarted worse than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is no time for stopping,&rsquo; said the voice of the giant&rsquo;s daughter, as
      he leant against the trunk to recover his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alas! I am no sooner up than down,&rsquo; answered he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Try once more,&rsquo; said she, and she laid a finger against the tree and bade
      him put his foot on it. Then she placed another finger a little higher up,
      and so on till he reached the top, where the magpie had built her nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Make haste now with the nest,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;for my father&rsquo;s breath is
      burning my back,&rsquo; and down he scrambled as fast as he could, but the
      girl&rsquo;s little finger had caught in a branch at the top, and she was
      obliged to leave it there. But she was too busy to pay heed to this, for
      the sun was getting high over the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen to me,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;This night my two sisters and I will be dressed
      in the same garments, and you will not know me. But when my father says
      &lsquo;Go to thy wife, king&rsquo;s son,&rsquo; come to the one whose right hand has no
      little finger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So he went and gave the eggs to the giant, who nodded his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Make ready for thy marriage,&rsquo; cried he, &lsquo;for the wedding shall take place
      this very night, and I will summon thy bride to greet thee.&rsquo; Then his
      three daughters were sent for, and they all entered dressed in green silk
      of the same fashion, and with golden circlets round their heads. The
      king&rsquo;s son looked from one to another. Which was the youngest? Suddenly
      his eyes fell on the hand of the middle one, and there was no little
      finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou hast aimed well this time too,&rsquo; said the giant, as the king&rsquo;s son
      laid his hand on her shoulder, &lsquo;but perhaps we may meet some other way&rsquo;;
      and though he pretended to laugh, the bride saw a gleam in his eye which
      warned her of danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wedding took place that very night, and the hall was filled with
      giants and gentlemen, and they danced till the house shook from top to
      bottom. At last everyone grew tired, and the guests went away, and the
      king&rsquo;s son and his bride were left alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If we stay here till dawn my father will kill thee,&rsquo; she whispered, &lsquo;but
      thou art my husband and I will save thee, as I did before,&rsquo; and she cut an
      apple into nine pieces, and put two pieces at the head of the bed, and two
      pieces at the foot, and two pieces at the door of the kitchen, and two at
      the big door, and one outside the house. And when this was done, and she
      heard the giant snoring, she and the king&rsquo;s son crept out softly and stole
      across to the stable, where she led out the blue-grey mare and jumped on
      its back, and her husband mounted behind her. Not long after, the giant
      awoke.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
 &lsquo;Are you asleep?&rsquo; asked he.
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not yet,&rsquo; answered the apple at the head of the bed, and the giant turned
      over, and soon was snoring as loudly as before. By and bye he called
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you asleep?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not yet,&rsquo; said the apple at the foot of the bed, and the giant was
      satisfied. After a while, he called a third time, &lsquo;Are you asleep?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not yet,&rsquo; replied the apple in the kitchen, but when in a few minutes, he
      put the question for the fourth time and received an answer from the apple
      outside the house door, he guessed what had happened, and ran to the room
      to look for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bed was cold and empty!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My father&rsquo;s breath is burning my back,&rsquo; cried the girl, &lsquo;put thy hand
      into the ear of the mare, and whatever thou findest there, throw it behind
      thee.&rsquo; And in the mare&rsquo;s ear there was a twig of sloe tree, and as he
      threw it behind him there sprung up twenty miles of thornwood so thick
      that scarce a weasel could go through it. And the giant, who was striding
      headlong forwards, got caught in it, and it pulled his hair and beard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is one of my daughter&rsquo;s tricks,&rsquo; he said to himself, &lsquo;but if I had
      my big axe and my wood-knife, I would not be long making a way through
      this,&rsquo; and off he went home and brought back the axe and the wood-knife.
    </p>
    <p>
      It took him but a short time to cut a road through the blackthorn, and
      then he laid the axe and the knife under a tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will leave them there till I return,&rsquo; he murmured to himself, but a
      hoodie crow, which was sitting on a branch above, heard him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If thou leavest them,&rsquo; said the hoodie, &lsquo;we will steal them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will,&rsquo; answered the giant, &lsquo;and I must take them home.&rsquo; So he took
      them home, and started afresh on his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My father&rsquo;s breath is burning my back,&rsquo; cried the girl at midday. &lsquo;Put
      thy finger in the mare&rsquo;s ear and throw behind thee whatever thou findest
      in it,&rsquo; and the king&rsquo;s son found a splinter of grey stone, and threw it
      behind him, and in a twinkling twenty miles of solid rock lay between them
      and the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My daughter&rsquo;s tricks are the hardest things that ever met me,&rsquo; said the
      giant, &lsquo;but if I had my lever and my crowbar, I would not be long in
      making my way through this rock also,&rsquo; but as he had got them, he had to
      go home and fetch them. Then it took him but a short time to hew his way
      through the rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will leave the tools here,&rsquo; he murmured aloud when he had finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If thou leavest them, we will steal them,&rsquo; said a hoodie who was perched
      on a stone above him, and the giant answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Steal them if thou wilt; there is no time to go back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My father&rsquo;s breath is burning my back,&rsquo; cried the girl; &lsquo;look in the
      mare&rsquo;s ear, king&rsquo;s son, or we are lost,&rsquo; and he looked, and found a tiny
      bladder full of water, which he threw behind him, and it became a great
      lock. And the giant, who was striding on so fast, could not stop himself,
      and he walked right into the middle and was drowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blue-grey mare galloped on like the wind, and the next day the king&rsquo;s
      son came in sight of his father&rsquo;s house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get down and go in,&rsquo; said the bride, &lsquo;and tell them that thou hast
      married me. But take heed that neither man nor beast kiss thee, for then
      thou wilt cease to remember me at all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will do thy bidding,&rsquo; answered he, and left her at the gate. All who
      met him bade him welcome, and he charged his father and mother not to kiss
      him, but as he greeted them his old greyhound leapt on his neck, and
      kissed him on the mouth. And after that he did not remember the giant&rsquo;s
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that day she sat on a well which was near the gate, waiting, waiting,
      but the king&rsquo;s son never came. In the darkness she climbed up into an oak
      tree that shadowed the well, and there she lay all night, waiting,
      waiting.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morrow, at midday, the wife of a shoemaker who dwelt near the well
      went to draw water for her husband to drink, and she saw the shadow of the
      girl in the tree, and thought it was her own shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How handsome I am, to be sure,&rsquo; said she, gazing into the well, and as
      she stopped to behold herself better, the jug struck against the stones
      and broke in pieces, and she was forced to return to her husband without
      the water, and this angered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou hast turned crazy,&rsquo; said he in wrath. &lsquo;Go thou, my daughter, and
      fetch me a drink,&rsquo; and the girl went, and the same thing befell her as had
      befallen her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is the water?&rsquo; asked the shoemaker, when she came back, and as she
      held nothing save the handle of the jug he went to the well himself. He
      too saw the reflection of the woman in the tree, but looked up to discover
      whence it came, and there above him sat the most beautiful woman in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come down,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;for a while thou canst stay in my house,&rsquo; and glad
      enough the girl was to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the king of the country was about to marry, and the young men about
      the court thronged the shoemaker&rsquo;s shop to buy fine shoes to wear at the
      wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou hast a pretty daughter,&rsquo; said they when they beheld the girl sitting
      at work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty she is,&rsquo; answered the shoemaker, &lsquo;but no daughter of mine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would give a hundred pounds to marry her,&rsquo; said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I,&rsquo; &lsquo;And I,&rsquo; cried the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is no business of mine,&rsquo; answered the shoemaker, and the young men
      bade him ask her if she would choose one of them for a husband, and to
      tell them on the morrow. Then the shoemaker asked her, and the girl said
      that she would marry the one who would bring his purse with him. So the
      shoemaker hurried to the youth who had first spoken, and he came back, and
      after giving the shoemaker a hundred pounds for his news, he sought the
      girl, who was waiting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it thou?&rsquo; inquired she. &lsquo;I am thirsty, give me a drink from the well
      that is yonder.&rsquo; And he poured out the water, but he could not move from
      the place where he was; and there he stayed till many hours had passed by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take away that foolish boy,&rsquo; cried the girl to the shoemaker at last, &lsquo;I
      am tired of him,&rsquo; and then suddenly he was able to walk, and betook
      himself to his home, but he did not tell the others what had happened to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next day there arrived one of the other young men, and in the evening,
      when the shoemaker had gone out and they were alone, she said to him, &lsquo;See
      if the latch is on the door.&rsquo; The young man hastened to do her bidding,
      but as soon as he touched the latch, his fingers stuck to it, and there he
      had to stay for many hours, till the shoemaker came back, and the girl let
      him go. Hanging his head, he went home, but he told no one what had
      befallen him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then was the turn of the third man, and his foot remained fastened to the
      floor, till the girl unloosed it. And thankfully, he ran off, and was not
      seen looking behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take the purse of gold,&rsquo; said the girl to the shoemaker, &lsquo;I have no need
      of it, and it will better thee.&rsquo; And the shoemaker took it and told the
      girl he must carry the shoes for the wedding up to the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would fain get a sight of the king&rsquo;s son before he marries,&rsquo; sighed
      she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come with me, then,&rsquo; answered he; &lsquo;the servants are all my friends, and
      they will let you stand in the passage down which the king&rsquo;s son will
      pass, and all the company too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Up they went to the castle, and when the young men saw the girl standing
      there, they led her into the hall where the banquet was laid out and
      poured her out some wine. She was just raising the glass to drink when a
      flame went up out of it, and out of the flame sprang two pigeons, one of
      gold and one of silver. They flew round and round the head of the girl,
      when three grains of barley fell on the floor, and the silver pigeon dived
      down, and swallowed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If thou hadst remembered how I cleaned the byre, thou wouldst have given
      me my share,&rsquo; cooed the golden pigeon, and as he spoke three more grains
      fell, and the silver pigeon ate them as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If thou hadst remembered how I thatched the byre, thou wouldst have given
      me my share,&rsquo; cooed the golden pigeon again; and as he spoke three more
      grains fell, and for the third time they were eaten by the silver pigeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If thou hadst remembered how I got the magpie&rsquo;s nest, thou wouldst have
      given me my share,&rsquo; cooed the golden pigeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the king&rsquo;s son understood that they had come to remind him of what he
      had forgotten, and his lost memory came back, and he knew his wife, and
      kissed her. But as the preparations had been made, it seemed a pity to
      waste them, so they were married a second time, and sat down to the
      wedding feast.

    <h2>
      The Lady of the Fountain.
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the centre of the great hall in the castle of Caerleon upon Usk, king
      Arthur sat on a seat of green rushes, over which was thrown a covering of
      flame-coloured silk, and a cushion of red satin lay under his elbow. With
      him were his knights Owen and Kynon and Kai, while at the far end, close
      to the window, were Guenevere the queen and her maidens embroidering white
      garments with strange devices of gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am weary,&rsquo; said Arthur, &lsquo;and till my food is prepared I would fain
      sleep. You yourselves can tell each other tales, and Kai will fetch you
      from the kitchen a flagon of mean and some meat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And when they had eaten and drunk, Kynon, the oldest among them, began his
      story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was the only son of my father and mother, and much store they set by
      me, but I was not content to stay with them at home, for I thought no deed
      in all the world was too mighty for me. None could hold me back, and after
      I had won many adventures in my own land, I bade farewell to my parents
      and set out to see the world. Over mountains, through deserts, across
      rivers I went, till I reached a fair valley full of trees, with a path
      running by the side of a stream. I walked along that path all the day, and
      in the evening I came to a castle in front of which stood two youths
      clothed in yellow, each grasping an ivory bow, with arrows made of the
      bones of the whale, and winged with peacock&rsquo;s feathers. By their sides
      hung golden daggers with hilts of the bones of the whale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Near these young men was a man richly dressed, who turned and went with
      me towards the castle, where all the dwellers were gathered in the hall.
      In one window I beheld four and twenty damsels, and the least fair of them
      was fairer than Guenevere at her fairest. Some took my horse, and others
      unbuckled my armour, and washed it, with my sword and spear, till it all
      shone like silver. Then I washed myself and put on a vest and doublet
      which they brought me, and I and the man that entered with me sat down
      before a table of silver, and a goodlier feast I never had.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All this time neither the man nor the damsels had spoken one word, but
      when our dinner was half over, and my hunger was stilled, the man began to
      ask who I was. Then I told him my name and my father&rsquo;s name, and why I
      came there, for indeed I had grown weary of gaining the mastery over all
      men at home, and sought if perchance there was one who could gain the
      mastery over me. And at this the man smiled and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;If I did not fear to distress thee too much, I would show thee what thou
      seekest.&rdquo; His words made me sorrowful and fearful of myself, which the man
      perceived, and added, &ldquo;If thou meanest truly what thou sayest, and
      desirest earnestly to prove thy valour, and not to boast vainly that none
      can overcome thee, I have somewhat to show thee. But to-night thou must
      sleep in the this castle, and in the morning see that thou rise early and
      follow the road upwards through the valley, until thou reachest a wood. In
      the wood is a path branching to the right; go along this path until thou
      comest to a space of grass with a mound in the middle of it. On the top of
      the mound stands a black man, larger than any two white men; his eye is in
      the centre of his forehead and he has only one foot. He carries a club of
      iron, and two white men could hardly lift it. Around him graze a thousand
      beasts, all of different kinds, for he is the guardian of that wood, and
      it is he who will tell thee which way to go in order to find the adventure
      thou art in quest of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So spake the man, and long did that night seem to me, and before dawn I
      rose and put on my armour, and mounted my horse and rode on till I reached
      the grassy space of which he had told me. There was the black man on top
      of the mound, as he had said, and in truth he was mightier in all ways
      than I had thought him to be. As for the club, Kai, it would have been a
      burden for four of our warriors. He waited for me to speak, and I asked
      him what power he held over the beasts that thronged so close about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;I will show thee, little man,&rdquo; he answered, and with his club he struck
      a stag on the head till he brayed loudly. And at his braying the animals
      came running, numerous as the stars in the sky, so that scarce was I able
      to stand among them. Serpents were there also, and dragons, and beasts of
      strange shapes, with horns in places where never saw I horns before. And
      the black man only looked at them and bade them go and feed. And they
      bowed themselves before him, as vassals before their lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Now, little man, I have answered thy question and showed thee my power,&rdquo;
       said he. &ldquo;Is there anything else thou wouldest know?&rdquo; Then I inquired of
      him my way, but he grew angry, and, as I perceived, would fain have
      hindered me; but at the last, after I had told him who I was, his anger
      passed from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Take that path,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that leads to the head of this grassy glade,
      and go up the wood till thou reachest the top. There thou wilt find an
      open space, and in the midst of it a tall tree. Under the tree is a
      fountain, and by the fountain a marble slab, and on the slab a bowl of
      silver, with a silver chain. Dip the bowl in the fountain, and throw the
      water on the slab, and thou wilt hear a might peal of thunder, till heaven
      and earth seem trembling with the noise. After the thunder will come hail,
      so fierce that scarcely canst thou endure it and live, for the hailstones
      are both large and thick. Then the sun will shine again, but every leaf of
      the tree will by lying on the ground. Next a flight of birds will come and
      alight on the tree, and never didst thou hear a strain so sweet as that
      which they will sing. And at the moment in which their song sounds
      sweetest thou wilt hear a murmuring and complaining coming towards thee
      along the valley, and thou wilt see a knight in black velvet bestriding a
      black horse, bearing a lance with a black pennon, and he will spur his
      steed so as to fight thee. If thou turnest to flee, he will overtake thee.
      And if thou abidest were thou art, he will unhorse thee. And if thou dost
      not find trouble in that adventure, thou needest not to seek it during the
      rest of thy life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I bade the black man farewell, and took my way to the top of the wood,
      and there I found everything just as I had been told. I went up to the
      tree beneath which stood the fountain, and filling the silver bowl with
      water, emptied it on the marble slab. Thereupon the thunder came, louder
      by far than I had expected to hear it, and after the thunder came the
      shower, but heavier by far than I had expected to feel it, for, of a truth
      I tell thee, Kai, not one of those hailstones would be stopped by skin or
      by flesh till it had reached the bone. I turned my horse&rsquo;s flank towards
      the shower, and, bending over his neck, held my shield so that it might
      cover his head and my own. When the hail had passed, I looked on the tree
      and not a single leaf was left on it, and the sky was blue and the sun
      shining, while on the branches were perched birds of very kind, who sang a
      song sweeter than any that has come to my ears, either before or since.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thus, Kai, I stood listening to the birds, when lo, a murmuring voice
      approached me, saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;O knight, what has brought thee hither? What evil have I done to thee,
      that thou shouldest do so much to me, for in all my lands neither man nor
      beast that met that shower has escaped alive.&rdquo; Then from the valley
      appeared the knight on the black horse, grasping the lance with the black
      pennon. Straightway we charged each other, and though I fought my best, he
      soon overcame me, and I was thrown to the ground, while the knight seized
      the bridle of my horse, and rode away with it, leaving me where I was,
      without even despoiling me of my armour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sadly did I go down the hill again, and when I reached the glade where
      the black man was, I confess to thee, Kai, it was a marvel that I did not
      melt into a liquid pool, so great was my shame. That night I slept at the
      castle where I had been before, and I was bathed and feasted, and none
      asked me how I had fared. The next morning when I arose I found a bay
      horse saddled for me, and, girdling on my armour, I returned to my own
      court. The horse is still in the stable, and I would not part with it for
      any in Britain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But of a truth, Kai, no man ever confessed an adventure so much to his
      own dishonour, and strange indeed it seems that none other man have I ever
      met that knew of the black man, and the knight and the shower.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would it not be well,&rsquo; said Owen, &lsquo;to go and discover the place?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the hand of my friend,&rsquo; answered Kai, &lsquo;often dost thou utter that with
      thy tongue which thou wouldest not make good with thy deeds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In truth,&rsquo; said Guenevere the queen, who had listened to the tale, &lsquo;thou
      wert better hanged, Kai, than use such speech towards a man like Owen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I meant nothing, lady,&rsquo; replied Kai; &lsquo;thy praise of Owen is not greater
      than mine.&rsquo; And as he spoke Arthur awoke, and asked if he had not slept
      for a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, lord,&rsquo; answered Owen, &lsquo;certainly thou hast slept.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it time for us to go to meat?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is, lord,&rsquo; answered Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the horn for washing themselves was sounded, and after that the king
      and his household sat down to eat. And when they had finished, Owen left
      them, and made ready his horse and his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the first rays of the sun he set forth, and travelled through deserts
      and over mountains and across rivers, and all befell him which had
      befallen Kynon, till he stood under the leafless tree listening to the
      song of the birds. Then he heard the voice, and turning to look found the
      knight galloping to meet him. Fiercely they fought till their lances were
      broken, and then they drew their swords, and a blow from Owen cut through
      the knight&rsquo;s helmet, and pierced his skull.
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling himself wounded unto death the knight fled, and Owen pursued him
      till they came to a splendid castle. Here the knight dashed across the
      bridge that spanned the moat, and entered the gate, but as soon as he was
      safe inside, the drawbridge was pulled up and caught Owen&rsquo;s horse in the
      middle, so that half of him was inside and half out, and Owen could not
      dismount and knew not what to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was in this sore plight a little door in the castle gate opened,
      and he could see a street facing him, with tall houses. Then a maiden with
      curling hair of gold looked through the little door and bade Owen open the
      gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By my troth!&rsquo; cried Owen, &lsquo;I can no more open it from here than thou art
      able to set me free.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;I will do my best to release thee if thou wilt do as I
      tell thee. Take this ring and put it on with the stone inside thy hand,
      and close thy fingers tight, for as long as thou dost conceal it, it will
      conceal thee. When the men inside have held counsel together, they will
      come to fetch thee to thy death, and they will be much grieved not to find
      thee. I will stand on the horse block yonder and thou canst see me though
      I cannot see thee. Therefore draw near and place thy hand on my shoulder
      and follow me wheresoever I go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon that she went away from Owen, and when the men came out from the
      castle to seek him and did not find him they were sorely grieved, and they
      returned to the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Owen went to the maiden and placed his hand on her shoulder, and she
      guided him to a large room, painted all over with rich colours, and
      adorned with images of gold. Here she gave him meat and drink, and water
      to wash with and garments to wear, and he lay down upon a soft bed, with
      scarlet and fur to cover him, and slept gladly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle of the night he woke hearing a great outcry, and he jumped
      up and clothed himself and went into the hall, where the maiden was
      standing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; he asked, and she answered that the knight who owned the
      castle was dead, and they were bearing his body to the church. Never had
      Owen beheld such vast crowds, and following the dead knight was the most
      beautiful lady in the world, whose cry was louder than the shout of the
      men, or the braying of the trumpets. And Owen looked on her and loved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is she?&rsquo; he asked the damsel. &lsquo;That is my mistress, the countess of
      the fountain, and the wife of him whom thou didst slay yesterday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Verily,&rsquo; said Owen, &lsquo;she is the woman that I love best.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She shall also love thee not a little,&rsquo; said the maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she left Owen, and after a while went into the chamber of her
      mistress, and spoke to her, but the countess answered her nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What aileth thee, mistress?&rsquo; inquired the maiden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why hast thou kept far from me in my grief, Luned?&rsquo; answered the
      countess, and in her turn the damsel asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it well for thee to mourn so bitterly for the dead, or for anything
      that is gone from thee?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no man in the world equal to him,&rsquo; replied the countess, her
      cheeks growing red with anger. &lsquo;I would fain banish thee for such words.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be not angry, lady,&rsquo; said Luned, &lsquo;but listen to my counsel. Thou knowest
      well that alone thou canst not preserve thy lands, therefore seek some one
      to help thee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how can I do that?&rsquo; asked the countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will tell thee,&rsquo; answered Luned. &lsquo;Unless thou canst defend the fountain
      all will be lost, and none can defend the fountain except a knight of
      Arthur&rsquo;s court. There will I go to seek him, and woe betide me if I return
      without a warrior that can guard the fountain, as well as he who kept it
      before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go then,&rsquo; said the countess, &lsquo;and make proof of that which thou hast
      promised.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So Luned set out, riding on a white palfrey, on pretence of journeying to
      King Arthur&rsquo;s court, but instead of doing that she hid herself for as many
      days as it would have taken her to go and come, and then she left her
      hiding-place, and went into the countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What news from the court?&rsquo; asked her mistress, when she had given Luned a
      warm greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The best of news,&rsquo; answered the maiden, &lsquo;for I have gained the object of
      my mission. When wilt thou that I present to thee the knight who has
      returned with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow at midday,&rsquo; said the countess, &lsquo;and I will cause all the people
      in the town to come together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Therefore the next day at noon Owen put on his coat of mail, and over it
      he wore a splendid mantle, while on his feet were leather shoes fastened
      with clasps of gold. And he followed Luned to the chamber of her mistress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Right glad was the countess to see them, but she looked closely at Owen
      and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Luned, this knight has scarcely the air of a traveller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What harm is there in that, lady?&rsquo; answered Luned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am persuaded,&rsquo; said the countess, &lsquo;that this man and no other chased
      the soul from the body of my lord.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Had he not been stronger than thy lord,&rsquo; replied the damsel, &lsquo;he could
      not have taken his life, and for that, and for all things that are past,
      there is no remedy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave me, both of you,&rsquo; said the countess, &lsquo;and I will take counsel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning the countess summoned her subjects to meet in the
      courtyard of the castle, and told them that now that her husband was dead
      there was none to defend her lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So choose you which it shall be,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Either let one of you take
      me for a wife, or give me your consent to take a new lord for myself, that
      my lands be not without a master.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At her words the chief men of the city withdrew into one corner and took
      counsel together, and after a while the leader came forward and said that
      they had decided that it was best, for the peace and safety of all, that
      she should choose a husband for herself. Thereupon Owen was summoned to
      her presence, and he accepted with joy the hand that she offered him, and
      they were married forthwith, and the men of the earldom did him homage.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that day Owen defended the fountain as the earl before him had done,
      and every knight that came by was overthrown by him, and his ransom
      divided among his barons. In this way three years passed, and no man in
      the world was more beloved than Owen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now at the end of the three years it happened that Gwalchmai the knight
      was with Arthur, and he perceived the king to be very sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My lord, has anything befallen thee?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Gwalchmai, I am grieved concerning Owen, whom I have lost these three
      years, and if a fourth year passes without him I can live no longer. And
      sure am I that the tale told by Kynon the son of Clydno caused me to lose
      him. I will go myself with the men of my household to avenge him if he is
      dead, to free him if he is in prison, to bring him back if he is alive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Arthur and three thousand men of his household set out in quest of
      Owen, and took Kynon for their guide. When Arthur reached the castle, the
      youths were shooting in the same place, and the same yellow man was
      standing by, and as soon as he beheld Arthur he greeted him and invited
      him in, and they entered together. So vast was the castle that the king&rsquo;s
      three thousand men were of no more account than if they had been twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      At sunrise Arthur departed thence, with Kynon for his guide, and reached
      the black man first, and afterwards the top of the wooded hill, with the
      fountain and the bowl and the tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My lord,&rsquo; said Kai, &lsquo;let me throw the water on the slab, and receive the
      first adventure that may befall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou mayest do so,&rsquo; answered Arthur, and Kai threw the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately all happened as before; the thunder and the shower of hail
      which killed many of Arthur&rsquo;s men; the song of the birds and the
      appearance of the black knight. And Kai met him and fought him, and was
      overthrown by him. Then the knight rode away, and Arthur and his men
      encamped where they stood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning Kai again asked leave to meet the knight and to try to
      overcome him, which Arthur granted. But once more he was unhorsed, and the
      black knight&rsquo;s lance broke his helmet and pierced the skin even to the
      bone, and humbled in spirit he returned to the camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this every one of the knights gave battle, but none came out victor,
      and at length there only remained Arthur himself and Gwalchmai.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, let me fight him, my lord,&rsquo; cried Gwalchmai, as he saw Arthur taking
      up his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, fight then,&rsquo; answered Arthur, and Gwalchmai threw a robe over
      himself and his horse, so that none knew him. All that day they fought,
      and neither was able to throw the other, and so it was on the next day. On
      the third day the combat was so fierce that they fell both to the ground
      at once, and fought on their feet, and at last the black knight gave his
      foe such a blow on his head that his helmet fell from his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not know it was thee, Gwalchmai,&rsquo; said the black knight. &lsquo;Take my
      sword and my arms.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; answered Gwalchmai, &lsquo;it is thou, Owen, who art the victor, take thou
      my sword&rsquo;; but Owen would not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me your swords,&rsquo; said Arthur from behind them, &lsquo;for neither of you
      has vanquished the other,&rsquo; and Owen turned and put his arms round Arthur&rsquo;s
      neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Arthur would have given orders to his men to make ready to go
      back whence they came, but Owen stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My lord,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;during the three years that I have been absent from
      thee I have been preparing a banquet for thee, knowing full well that thou
      wouldst come to seek me. Tarry with me, therefore, for a while, thou and
      thy men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they rode to the castle of the countess of the fountain, and spent
      three months in resting and feasting. And when it was time for them to
      depart Arthur besought the countess that she would allow Owen to go with
      him to Britain for the space of three months. With a sore heart she
      granted permission, and so content was Owen to be once more with his old
      companions that three years instead of three months passed away like a
      dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day Owen sat at meat in the castle of Caerleon upon Usk, when a damsel
      on a bay horse entered the hall, and riding straight up to the place where
      Owen sat she stooped and drew the ring from off his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thus shall be treated the traitor and the faithless,&rsquo; said she, and
      turning her horse&rsquo;s head she rode out of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      At her words Owen remembered all that he had forgotten, and sorrowful and
      ashamed he went to his own chamber and made ready to depart. At the dawn
      he set out, but he did not go back to the castle, for his heart was heavy,
      but he wandered far into wild places till his body was weak and thin, and
      his hair was long. The wild beasts were his friends, and he slept by their
      side, but in the end he longed to see the face of a man again, and he came
      down into a valley and fell asleep by a lake in the lands of a widowed
      countess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now it was the time when the countess took her walk, attended by her
      maidens, and when they saw a man lying by the lake they shrank back in
      terror, for he lay so still that they thought he was dead. But when they
      had overcome their fright, they drew near him, and touched him, and saw
      that there was life in him. Then the countess hastened to the castle, and
      brought from it a flask full of precious ointment and gave it to one of
      her maidens.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take that horse which is grazing yonder,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and a suit of men&rsquo;s
      garments, and place them near the man, and pour some of this ointment near
      his heart. If there is any life in him that will bring it back. But if he
      moves, hide thyself in the bushes near by, and see what he does.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The damsel took the flask and did her mistress&rsquo; bidding. Soon the man
      began to move his arms, and then rose slowly to his feet. Creeping forward
      step by step he took the garments from off the saddle and put them on him,
      and painfully he mounted the horse. When he was seated the damsel came
      forth and greeted him, and glad was he when he saw her and inquired what
      castle that was before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It belongs to a widowed countess,&rsquo; answered the maiden. &lsquo;Her husband left
      her two earldoms, but it is all that remains of her broad lands, for they
      have been torn from her by a young earl, because she would not marry him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is a pity,&rsquo; replied Owen, but he said no more, for he was too weak
      to talk much. Then the maiden guided him to the castle, and kindled a
      fire, and brought him food. And there he stayed and was tended for three
      months, till he was handsomer than ever he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      At noon one day Owen heard a sound of arms outside the castle, and he
      asked of the maiden what it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the earl of whom I spoke to thee,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;who has come with
      a great host to carry off my mistress.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Beg of her to lend me a horse and armour,&rsquo; said Owen, and the maiden did
      so, but the countess laughed somewhat bitterly as she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay, but I will give them to him, and such a horse and armour and weapons
      as he has never had yet, though I know not what use they will be to him.
      Yet mayhap it will save them from falling into the hands of my enemies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse was brought out and Owen rode forth with two pages behind him,
      and they saw the great host encamped before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is the earl?&rsquo; said he, and the pages answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In yonder troop where are four yellow standards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Await me,&rsquo; said Owen, &lsquo;at the gate of the castle, and he cried a
      challenge to the earl, who came to meet him. Hard did they fight, but Owen
      overthrew his enemy and drove him in front to the castle gate and into the
      hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Behold the reward of thy blessed balsam,&rsquo; said he, as he bade the earl
      kneel down before her, and made him swear that he would restore all that
      he had taken from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that he departed, and went into the deserts, and as he was passing
      through a wood he heard a loud yelling. Pushing aside the bushes he beheld
      a lion standing on a great mound, and by it a rock. Near the rock was a
      lion seeking to reach the mound, and each time he moved out darted a
      serpent from the rock to prevent him. Then Owen unsheathed his sword, and
      cut off the serpent&rsquo;s head and went on his way, and the lion followed and
      played about him, as if he had been a greyhound. And much more useful was
      he than a greyhound, for in the evening he brought large logs in his mouth
      to kindle a fire, and killed a fat buck for dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen made his fire and skinned the buck, and put some of it to roast, and
      gave the rest to the lion for supper. While he was waiting for the meat to
      cook he heard a sound of deep sighing close to him, and he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are thou?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am Luned,&rsquo; replied a voice from a cave so hidden by bushes and green
      hanging plants that Owen had not seen it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what dost thou here?&rsquo; cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am held captive in this cave on account of the knight who married the
      countess and left her, for the pages spoke ill of him, and because I told
      them that no man living was his equal they dragged me here and said I
      should die unless he should come to deliver me by a certain day, and that
      is no further than the day after to-morrow. His name is Owen the son of
      Urien, but I have none to send to tell him of my danger, or of a surety he
      would deliver me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Owen held his peace, but gave the maiden some of the meat, and bade her be
      of good cheer. Then, followed by the lion, he set out for a great castle
      on the other side of the plain, and men came and took his horse and placed
      it in a manger, and the lion went after and lay down on the straw.
      Hospitable and kind were all within the castle, but so full of sorrow that
      it might have been thought death was upon them. At length, when they had
      eaten and drunk, Owen prayed the earl to tell him the reason of their
      grief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yesterday,&rsquo; answered the earl, &lsquo;my two sons were seized, while thy were
      hunting, by a monster who dwells on those mountains yonder, and he vows
      that he will not let them go unless I give him my daughter to wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That shall never be,&rsquo; said Owen; &lsquo;but what form hath this monster?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In shape he is a man, but in stature he is a giant,&rsquo; replied the earl,
      &lsquo;and it were better by far that he should slay my sons than that I should
      give up my daughter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Early next morning the dwellers in the castle were awakened by a great
      clamour, and they found that the giant had arrived with the two young men.
      Swiftly Owen put on his armour and went forth to meet the giant, and the
      lion followed at his heels. And when the great beast beheld the hard blows
      which the giant dealt his master he flew at his throat, and much trouble
      had the monster in beating him off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Truly,&rsquo; said the giant, &lsquo;I should find no difficulty in fighting thee, if
      it were not for that lion.&rsquo; When he heard that Owen felt shame that he
      could not overcome the giant with his own sword, so he took the lion and
      shut him up in one of the towers of the castle, and returned to the fight.
      But from the sound of the blows the lion knew that the combat was going
      ill for Owen, so he climbed up till he reached the top of the tower, where
      there was a door on to the roof, and from the tower he sprang on to the
      walls, and from the walls to the ground. Then with a loud roar he leaped
      upon the giant, who fell dead under the blow of his paw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the gloom of the castle was turned into rejoicing, and the earl begged
      Owen to stay with him till he could make him a feast, but the knight said
      he had other work to do, and rode back to the place where he had left
      Luned, and the lion followed at his heels. When he came there he saw a
      great fire kindled, and two youths leading out the maiden to cast her upon
      the pile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; he cried, dashing up to them. &lsquo;What charge have you against her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She boasted that no man in the world was equal to Owen,&rsquo; said they, &lsquo;and
      we shut her in a cave, and agreed that none should deliver her but Owen
      himself, and that if he did not come by a certain day she should die. And
      now the time has past and there is no sign of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In truth he is a good knight, and had he but known that the maid was in
      peril he would have come to save her,&rsquo; said Owen; &lsquo;but accept me in his
      stead, I entreat you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will,&rsquo; replied they, and the fight began.
    </p>
    <p>
      The youths fought well and pressed hard on Owen, and when the lion saw
      that he came to help his master. But the youths made a sign for the fight
      to stop, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chieftain, it was agreed we should give battle to thee alone, and it is
      harder for us to contend with yonder beast than with thee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Owen shut up the lion in the cave where the maiden had been in
      prison, and blocked up the front with stones. But the fight with the giant
      had sorely tried him, and the youths fought well, and pressed him harder
      than before. And when the lion saw that he gave a loud roar, and burst
      through the stones, and sprang upon the youths and slew them. And so Luned
      was delivered at the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the maiden rode back with Owen to the lands of the lady of the
      fountain. And he took the lady with him to Arthur&rsquo;s court, where they
      lived happily till they died.

      In the old land of Brittany, once called Cornwall, there lived a woman
      named Barbaik Bourhis, who spent all her days in looking after her farm
      with the help of her niece Tephany. Early and late the two might be seen
      in the fields or in the dairy, milking cows, making butter, feeding fowls;
      working hard themselves and taking care that others worked too. Perhaps it
      might have been better for Barbaik if she had left herself a little time
      to rest and to think about other things, for soon she grew to love money
      for its own sake, and only gave herself and Tephany the food and clothes
      they absolutely needed. And as for poor people she positively hated them,
      and declared that such lazy creatures had no business in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, this being the sort of person Barbaik was, it is easy to guess at
      her anger when one day she found Tephany talking outside the cowhouse to
      young Denis, who was nothing more than a day labourer from the village of
      Plover. Seizing her niece by the arm, she pulled her sharply away,
      exclaiming:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you not ashamed, girl, to waste your time over a man who is as poor
      as a rat, when there are a dozen more who would be only too happy to buy
      you rings of silver, if you would let them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Denis is a good workman, as you know very well,&rsquo; answered Tephany, red
      with anger, &lsquo;and he puts by money too, and soon he will be able to take a
      farm for himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; cried Barbaik, &lsquo;he will never save enough for a farm till he
      is a hundred. I would sooner see you in your grave than the wife of a man
      who carries his whole fortune on his back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does fortune matter when one is young and strong?&rsquo; asked Tephany,
      but her aunt, amazed at such words, would hardly let her finish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What does fortune matter?&rsquo; repeated Barbaik, in a shocked voice. &lsquo;Is it
      possible that you are really so foolish as to despise money? If this is
      what you learn from Denis, I forbid you to speak to him, and I will have
      him turned out of the farm if he dares to show his face here again. Now go
      and wash the clothes and spread them out to dry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tephany did not dare to disobey, but with a heavy heart went down the path
      to the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is harder than these rocks,&rsquo; said the girl to herself, &lsquo;yes, a
      thousand times harder. For the rain at least can at last wear away the
      stone, but you might cry for ever, and she would never care. Talking to
      Denis is the only pleasure I have, and if I am not to see him I may as
      well enter a convent.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thinking these thoughts she reached the bank, and began to unfold the
      large packet of linen that had to be washed. The tap of a stick made her
      look up, and standing before her she saw a little old woman, whose face
      was strange to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would like to sit down and rest, granny?&rsquo; asked Tephany, pushing
      aside her bundle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When the sky is all the roof you have, you rest where you will,&rsquo; replied
      the old woman in trembling tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you so lonely, then?&rsquo; inquired Tephany, full of pity. &lsquo;Have you no
      friends who would welcome you into their houses?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They all died long, long ago,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;and the only friends I have
      are strangers with kind hearts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl did not speak for a moment, then held out the small loaf and some
      bacon intended for her dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take this,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;to-day at any rate you shall dine well,&rsquo; and the
      old woman took it, gazing at Tephany the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those who help others deserve to be helped,&rsquo; she answered; &lsquo;your eyes are
      still red because that miser Barbaik has forbidden you to speak to the
      young man from Plover. But cheer up, you are a good girl, and I will give
      you something that will enable you to see him once every day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You?&rsquo; cried Tephany, stupefied at discovering that the beggar knew all
      about her affairs, but the old woman did not hear her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take this long copper pin,&rsquo; she went on, &lsquo;and every time you stick it in
      your dress Mother Bourhis will be obliged to leave the house in order to
      go and count her cabbages. As long as the pin is in your dress you will be
      free, and your aunt will not come back until you have put it in its case
      again.&rsquo; Then, rising, she nodded to Tephany and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stood where she was, as still as a stone. If it had not been for
      the pin in her hands she would have thought she was dreaming. But by that
      token she knew it was no common old woman who had given it to her, but a
      fairy, wise in telling what would happen in the days to come. Then
      suddenly Tephany&rsquo;s eyes fell on the clothes, and to make up for lost time
      she began to wash them with great vigour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next evening, at the moment when Denis was accustomed to wait for her in
      the shadow of the cowhouse, Tephany stuck the pin in her dress, and at the
      very same instant Barbaik took up her sabots or wooden shoes and went
      through the orchard and past to the fields, to the plot where the cabbages
      grew. With a heart as light as her footsteps, the girl ran from the house,
      and spent her evening happily with Denis. And so it was for many days
      after that. Then, at last, Tephany began to notice something, and the
      something made her very sad.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first, Denis seemed to find the hours that they were together fly as
      quickly as she did, but when he had taught her all the songs he knew, and
      told her all the plans he had made for growing rich and a great man, he
      had nothing more to say to her, for he, like a great many other people,
      was fond of talking himself, but not of listening to any one else.
      Sometimes, indeed, he never came at all, and the next evening he would
      tell Tephany that he had been forced to go into the town on business, but
      though she never reproached him she was not deceived and saw plainly that
      he no longer cared for her as he used to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day by day her heart grew heavier and her cheeks paler, and one evening,
      when she had waited for him in vain, she put her water-pot on her shoulder
      and went slowly down to the spring. On the path in front of her stood the
      fairy who had given her the pin, and as she glanced at Tephany she gave a
      little mischievous laugh and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, my pretty maiden hardly looks happier than she did before, in spite
      of meeting her lover whenever she pleases.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has grown tired of me,&rsquo; answered Tephany in a trembling voice, &lsquo;and he
      makes excuses to stay away. Ah! granny dear, it is not enough to be able
      to see him, I must be able to amuse him and to keep him with me. He is so
      clever, you know. Help me to be clever too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that what you want?&rsquo; cried the old woman. &lsquo;Well, take this feather and
      stick it in your hair, and you will be as wise as Solomon himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Blushing with pleasure Tephany went home and stuck the feather into the
      blue ribbon which girls always wear in that part of the country. In a
      moment she heard Denis whistling gaily, and as her aunt was safely
      counting her cabbages, she hurried out to meet him. The young man was
      struck dumb by her talk. There was nothing that she did not seem to know,
      and as for songs she not only could sing those from every part of
      Brittany, but could compose them herself. Was this really the quiet girl
      who had been so anxious to learn all he could teach her, or was it
      somebody else? Perhaps she had gone suddenly mad, and there was an evil
      spirit inside her. But in any case, night after night he came back, only
      to find her growing wiser and wiser. Soon the neighbours whispered their
      surprise among themselves, for Tephany had not been able to resist the
      pleasure of putting the feather in her hair for some of the people who
      despised her for her poor clothes, and many were the jokes she made about
      them. Of course they heard of her jests, and shook their heads saying:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is an ill-natured little cat, and the man that marries her will find
      that it is she who will hold the reins and drive the horse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not long before Denis began to agree with them, and as he always
      liked to be master wherever he went, he became afraid of Tephany&rsquo;s sharp
      tongue, and instead of laughing as before when she made fun of other
      people he grew red and uncomfortable, thinking that his turn would come
      next.
    </p>
    <p>
      So matters went on till one evening Denis told Tephany that he really
      could not stay a moment, as he had promised to go to a dance that was to
      be held in the next village.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tephany&rsquo;s face fell; she had worked hard all day, and had been counting on
      a quiet hour with Denis. She did her best to persuade him to remain with
      her, but he would not listen, and at last she grew angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I know why you are so anxious not to miss the dance,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;it
      is because Aziliez of Pennenru will be there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Aziliez was the loveliest girl for miles round, and she and Denis had
      known each other from childhood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, Aziliez will be there,&rsquo; answered Denis, who was quite pleased to
      see her jealous, &lsquo;and naturally one would go a long way to watch her
      dance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go then!&rsquo; cried Tephany, and entering the house she slammed the door
      behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lonely and miserable she sat down by the fire and stared into the red
      embers. Then, flinging the feather from her hair, she put her head on her
      hands, and sobbed passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the use of being clever when it is beauty that men want? That is
      what I ought to have asked for. But it is too late, Denis will never come
      back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Since you wish it so much you shall have beauty,&rsquo; said a voice at her
      side, and looking round she beheld the old woman leaning on her stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fasten this necklace round your neck, and as long as you wear it you will
      be the most beautiful woman in the world,&rsquo; continued the fairy. With a
      little shriek of joy Tephany took the necklace, and snapping the clasp ran
      to the mirror which hung in the corner. Ah, this time she was not afraid
      of Aziliez or of any other girl, for surely none could be as fair and
      white as she. And with the sight of her face a thought came to her, and
      putting on hastily her best dress and her buckled shoes she hurried off to
      the dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the way she met a beautiful carriage with a young man seated in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a lovely maiden!&rsquo; he exclaimed, as Tephany approached. &lsquo;Why, there
      is not a girl in my own country that can be compared to her. She, and no
      other, shall be my bride.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The carriage was large and barred the narrow road, so Tephany was forced,
      much against her will, to remain where she was. But she looked the young
      man full in the face as she answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go your way, noble lord, and let me go mine. I am only a poor peasant
      girl, accustomed to milk, and make hay and spin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peasant you may be, but I will make you a great lady,&rsquo; said he, taking
      her hand and trying to lead her to the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to be a great lady, I only want to be the wife of Denis,&rsquo; 
      she replied, throwing off his hand and running to the ditch which divided
      the road from the cornfield, where he hoped to hide. Unluckily the young
      man guessed what she was doing, and signed to his attendants, who seized
      her and put her in the coach. The door was banged, and the horses whipped
      up into a gallop.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the end of an hour they arrived at a splendid castle, and Tephany, who
      would not move, was lifted out and carried into the hall, while a priest
      was sent for to perform the marriage ceremony. The young man tried to win
      a smile from her by telling of all the beautiful things she should have as
      his wife, but Tephany did not listen to him, and looked about to see if
      there was any means by which she could escape. It did not seem easy. The
      three great doors were closely barred, and the one through which she had
      entered shut with a spring, but her feather was still in her hair, and by
      its aid she detected a crack in the wooden panelling, through which a
      streak of light could be dimly seen. Touching the copper pin which
      fastened her dress, the girl sent every one in the hall to count the
      cabbages, while she herself passed through the little door, not knowing
      whither she was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time night had fallen, and Tephany was very tired. Thankfully she
      found herself at the gate of a convent, and asked if she might stay there
      till morning. But the portress answered roughly that it was no place for
      beggars, and bade her begone, so the poor girl dragged herself slowly
      along the road, till a light and the bark of a dog told her that she was
      near a farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front of the house was a group of people; two or three women and the
      sons of the farmer. When their mother heard Tephany&rsquo;s request to be given
      a bed the good wife&rsquo;s heart softened, and she was just going to invite her
      inside, when the young men, whose heads were turned by the girl&rsquo;s beauty,
      began to quarrel as to which should do most for her. From words they came
      to blows, and the women, frightened at the disturbance, pelted Tephany
      with insulting names. She quickly ran down the nearest path, hoping to
      escape them in the darkness of the trees, but in an instant she heard
      their footsteps behind her. Wild with fear her legs trembled under her,
      when suddenly she bethought herself of her necklace. With a violent effort
      she burst the clasp and flung it round the neck of a pig which was
      grunting in a ditch, and as she did so she heard the footsteps cease from
      pursuing her and run after the pig, for her charm had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      On she went, scarcely knowing where she was going, till she found herself,
      to her surprise and joy, close to her aunt&rsquo;s house. For several days she
      felt so tired and unhappy that she could hardly get through her work, and
      to make matters worse Denis scarcely ever came near her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was too busy,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and really it was only rich people who could
      afford to waste time in talking.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the days went on Tephany grew paler and paler, till everybody noticed
      it except her aunt. The water-pot was almost too heavy for her now, but
      morning and evening she carried it to the spring, though the effort to
      lift it to her shoulder was often too much for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How could I have been so foolish,&rsquo; she whispered to herself, when she
      went down as usual at sunset. &lsquo;It was not freedom to see Denis that I
      should have asked for, for he was soon weary of me, nor a quick tongue,
      for he was afraid of it, nor beauty, for that brought me nothing but
      trouble, but riches which make life easy both for oneself and others. Ah!
      if I only dared to beg this gift from the fairy, I should be wiser than
      before and know how to choose better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be satisfied,&rsquo; said the voice of the old woman, who seemed to be standing
      unseen at Tephany&rsquo;s elbow. &lsquo;If you look in your right-hand pocket when you
      go home you will find a small box. Rub your eyes with the ointment it
      contains, and you will see that you yourself contain a priceless
      treasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tephany did not in the least understand what she meant, but ran back to
      the farm as fast as she could, and began to fumble joyfully in her
      right-hand pocket. Sure enough, there was the little box with the precious
      ointment. She was in the act of rubbing her eyes with it when Barbaik
      Bourhis entered the room. Ever since she had been obliged to leave her
      work and pass her time, she did not know why, in counting cabbages,
      everything had gone wrong, and she could not get a labourer to stay with
      her because of her bad temper. When, therefore, she saw her niece standing
      quietly before her mirror, Barbaik broke out:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So this is what you do when I am out in the fields! Ah! it is no wonder
      if the farm is ruined. Are you not ashamed, girl, to behave so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tephany tried to stammer some excuse, but her aunt was half mad with rage,
      and a box on the ears was her only answer. At this Tephany, hurt,
      bewildered and excited, could control herself no longer, and turning away
      burst into tears. But what was her surprise when she saw that each
      tear-drop was a round and shining pearl. Barbaik, who also beheld this
      marvel, uttered a cry of astonishment, and threw herself on her knees to
      pick them up from the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was still gathering them when the door opened and in came Denis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pearls! Are they really pearls?&rsquo; he asked, falling on his knees also, and
      looking up at Tephany he perceived others still more beautiful rolling
      down the girl&rsquo;s cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care not to let any of the neighbours hear of it, Denis,&rsquo; said
      Barbaik. &lsquo;Of course you shall have your share, but nobody else shall get a
      single one. Cry on, my dear, cry on,&rsquo; she continued to Tephany. It is for
      your good as well as ours,&rsquo; and she held out her apron to catch them, and
      Denis his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Tephany could hardly bear any more. She felt half choked at the sight
      of their greediness, and wanted to rush from the hall, and though Barbaik
      caught her arm to prevent this, and said all sorts of tender words which
      she thought would make the girl weep the more, Tephany with a violent
      effort forced back her tears, and wiped her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is she finished already?&rsquo; cried Barbaik, in a tone of disappointment.
      &lsquo;Oh, try again, my dear. Do you think it would do any good to beat her a
      little?&rsquo; she added to Denis, who shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is enough for the first time. I will go into the town and find out
      the value of each pearl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I will go with you,&rsquo; said Barbaik, who never trusted anyone and was
      afraid of being cheated. So the two went out, leaving Tephany behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat quite still on her chair, her hands clasped tightly together, as
      if she was forcing something back. At last she raised her eyes, which had
      been fixed on the ground, and beheld the fairy standing in a dark corner
      by the hearth, observing her with a mocking look. The girl trembled and
      jumped up, then, taking the feather, the pin, and the box, she held them
      out to the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here they are, all of them,&rsquo; she cried; &lsquo;they belong to you. Let me never
      see them again, but I have learned the lesson that they taught me. Others
      may have riches, beauty and wit, but as for me I desire nothing but to be
      the poor peasant girl I always was, working hard for those she loves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you have learned your lesson,&rsquo; answered the fairy, &lsquo;and now you
      shall lead a peaceful life and marry the man you love. For after all it
      was not yourself you thought of but him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Never again did Tephany see the old woman, but she forgave Denis for
      selling her tears, and in time he grew to be a good husband, who did his
      own share of work.

      The Groac&rsquo;h of the Isle of Lok
    </h2>
    <p>
      In old times, when all kinds of wonderful things happened in Brittany,
      there lived in the village of Lanillis, a young man named Houarn Pogamm
      and a girl called Bellah Postik. They were cousins, and as their mothers
      were great friends, and constantly in and out of each other&rsquo;s houses, they
      had often been laid in the same cradle, and had played and fought over
      their games.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When they are grown up they will marry,&rsquo; said the mothers; but just as
      every one was beginning to think of wedding bells, the two mothers died,
      and the cousins, who had no money, went as servants in the same house.
      This was better than being parted, of course, but not so good as having a
      little cottage of their own, where they could do as they liked, and soon
      they might have been heard bewailing to each other the hardness of their
      lots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If we could only manage to buy a cow and get a pig to fatten,&rsquo; grumbled
      Houarn, &lsquo;I would rent a bit of ground from the master, and then we could
      be married.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; answered Bellah, with a deep sigh; &lsquo;but we live in such hard times,
      and at the last fair the price of pigs had risen again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall have long to wait, that is quite clear,&rsquo; replied Houarn, turning
      away to his work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever they met they repeated their grievances, and at length Houarn&rsquo;s
      patience was exhausted, and one morning he came to Bellah and told her
      that he was going away to seek his fortune.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was very unhappy as she listened to this, and felt sorry that she
      had not tried to make the best of things. She implored Houarn not to leave
      her, but he would listen to nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The birds,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;continue flying until they reach a field of corn,
      and the bees do not stop unless they find the honey-giving flowers, and
      why should a man have less sense than they? Like them, I shall seek till I
      get what I want&mdash;that is, money to buy a cow and a pig to fatten. And
      if you love me, Bellah, you won&rsquo;t attempt to hinder a plan which will
      hasten our marriage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl saw it was useless to say more, so she answered sadly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, go then, since you must. But first I will divide with you all that
      my parents left me,&rsquo; and going to her room, she opened a small chest, and
      took from it a bell, a knife, and a little stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This bell,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;can be heard at any distance, however far, but it
      only rings to warn us that our friends are in great danger. The knife
      frees all it touches from the spells that have been laid on them; while
      the stick will carry you wherever you want to go. I will give you the
      knife to guard you against the enchantments of wizards, and the bell to
      tell me of your perils. The stick I shall keep for myself, so that I can
      fly to you if ever you have need of me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they cried for a little on each other&rsquo;s necks, and Houarn started for
      the mountains.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in those days, as in these, beggars abounded, and through every
      village he passed they followed Houarn in crowds, mistaking him for a
      gentleman, because there were no holes in his clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no fortune to be made here,&rsquo; he thought to himself; &lsquo;it is a
      place for spending, and not earning. I see I must go further,&rsquo; and he
      walked on to Pont-aven, a pretty little town built on the bank of a river.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sitting on a bench outside an inn, when he heard two men who were
      loading their mules talking about the Groac&rsquo;h of the island of Lok.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is a Groac&rsquo;h?&rsquo; asked he. &lsquo;I have never come across one.&rsquo; And the men
      answered that it was the name given to the fairy that dwelt in the lake,
      and that she was rich&mdash;oh! richer than all the kings in the world put
      together. Many had gone to the island to try and get possession of her
      treasures, but no one had ever come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he listened Houarn&rsquo;s mind was made up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will go, and return too,&rsquo; he said to the muleteers. They stared at him
      in astonishment, and besought him not to be so mad and to throw away his
      life in such a foolish manner; but he only laughed, and answered that if
      they could tell him of any other way in which to procure a cow and a pig
      to fatten, he would think no more about it. But the men did not know how
      this was to be done, and, shaking their heads over his obstinacy, left him
      to his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Houarn went down to the sea, and found a boatman who engaged to take
      him to the isle of Lok.
    </p>
    <p>
      The island was large, and lying almost across it was a lake, with a narrow
      opening to the sea. Houarn paid the boatman and sent him away, and then
      proceeded to walk round the lake. At one end he perceived a small skiff,
      painted blue and shaped like a swan, lying under a clump of yellow broom.
      As far as he could see, the swan&rsquo;s head was tucked under its wing, and
      Houarn, who had never beheld a boat of the sort, went quickly towards it
      and stepped in, so as to examine it the better. But no sooner was he on
      board than the swan woke suddenly up; his head emerged from under his
      wing, his feet began to move in the water, and in another moment they were
      in the middle of the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the young man had recovered from his surprise, he prepared to
      jump into the lake and swim to shore. But the bird had guessed his
      intentions, and plunged beneath the water, carrying Houarn with him to the
      palace of the Groac&rsquo;h.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, unless you have been under the sea and beheld all the wonders that
      lie there, you can never have an idea what the Groac&rsquo;h&rsquo;s palace was like.
      It was all made of shells, blue and green and pink and lilac and white,
      shading into each other till you could not tell where one colour ended and
      the other began. The staircases were of crystal, and every separate stair
      sang like a woodland bird as you put your foot on it. Round the palace
      were great gardens full of all the plants that grow in the sea, with
      diamonds for flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a large hall the Groac&rsquo;h was lying on a couch of gold. The pink and
      white of her face reminded you of the shells of her palace, while her long
      black hair was intertwined with strings of coral, and her dress of green
      silk seemed formed out of the sea. At the sight of her Houarn stopped,
      dazzled by her beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; said the Groac&rsquo;h, rising to her feet. &lsquo;Strangers and handsome
      youths are always welcome here. Do not be shy, but tell me how you found
      your way, and what you want.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name is Houarn,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;Lanillis is my home, and I am trying to
      earn enough money to buy a little cow and a pig to fatten.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you can easily get that,&rsquo; replied she; &lsquo;it is nothing to worry
      about. Come in and enjoy yourself.&rsquo; And she beckoned him to follow her
      into a second hall whose floors and walls were formed of pearls, while
      down the sides there were tables laden with fruit and wines of all kinds;
      and as he ate and drank, the Groac&rsquo;h talked to him and told him how the
      treasures he saw came from shipwrecked vessels, and were brought to her
      palace by a magic current of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not wonder,&rsquo; exclaimed Houarn, who now felt quite at home&mdash;&lsquo;I
      do not wonder that the people on the earth have so much to say about you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The rich are always envied.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For myself,&rsquo; he added, with a laugh, &lsquo;I only ask for the half of your
      wealth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can have it, if you will, Houarn,&rsquo; answered the fairy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; cried he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My husband, Korandon, is dead,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;and if you wish it, I will
      marry you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man gazed at her in surprise. Could any one so rich and so
      beautiful really wish to be his wife? He looked at her again, and Bellah
      was forgotten as he answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A man would be mad indeed to refuse such an offer. I can only accept it
      with joy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then the sooner it is done the better,&rsquo; said the Groac&rsquo;h, and gave orders
      to her servants. After that was finished, she begged Houarn to accompany
      her to a fish-pond at the bottom of the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come lawyer, come miller, come tailor, come singer!&rsquo; cried she, holding
      out a net of steel; and at each summons a fish appeared and jumped into
      the net. When it was full she went into a large kitchen and threw them all
      into a golden pot; but above the bubbling of the water Houarn seemed to
      hear the whispering of little voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is it whispering in the golden pot, Groac&rsquo;h?&rsquo; he inquired at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is nothing but the noise of the wood sparkling,&rsquo; she answered; but it
      did not sound the least like that to Houarn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There it is again,&rsquo; he said, after a short pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The water is getting hot, and it makes the fish jump,&rsquo; she replied; but
      soon the noise grew louder and like cries.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; asked Houarn, beginning to feel uncomfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just the crickets on the hearth,&rsquo; said she, and broke into a song which
      drowned the cries from the pot.
    </p>
    <p>
      But though Houarn held his peace, he was not as happy as before. Something
      seemed to have gone wrong, and then he suddenly remembered Bellah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it possible I can have forgotten her so soon? What a wretch I am!&rsquo; he
      thought to himself; and he remained apart and watched the Groac&rsquo;h while
      she emptied the fish into a plate, and bade him eat his dinner while she
      fetched wine from her cellar in a cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Houarn sat down and took out the knife which Bellah had given him, but as
      soon as the blade touched the fish the enchantment ceased, and four men
      stood before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Houarn, save us, we entreat you, and save yourself too!&rsquo; murmured they,
      not daring to raise their voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it must have been you who were crying out in the pot just now!&rsquo; 
      exclaimed Houarn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, it was us,&rsquo; they answered. &lsquo;Like you, we came to the isle of Lok to
      seek our fortunes, and like you we consented to marry the Groac&rsquo;h, and no
      sooner was the ceremony over than she turned us into fishes, as she had
      done to all our forerunners, who are in the fish-pond still, where you
      will shortly join them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this Houarn leaped into the air, as if he already felt himself
      frizzling in the golden pot. He rushed to the door, hoping to escape that
      way; but the Groac&rsquo;h, who had heard everything, met him on the threshold.
      Instantly she threw the steel net over his head, and the eyes of a little
      green frog peeped through the meshes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall go and play with the rest,&rsquo; she said, carrying him off to the
      fish-pond.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at this very moment that Bellah, who was skimming the milk in the
      farm dairy, heard the fairy bell tinkle violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound she grew pale, for she knew it meant that Houarn was in
      danger; and, hastily, changing the rough dress she wore for her work, she
      left the farm with the magic stick in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her knees were trembling under her, but she ran as fast as she could to
      the cross roads, where she drove her stick into the ground, murmuring as
      she did so a verse her mother had taught her:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Little staff of apple-tree,
         Over the earth and over the sea,
     Up in the air be guide to me,
         Everywhere to wander free,
</pre>
    <p>
      and immediately the stick became a smart little horse, with a rosette at
      each ear and a feather on his forehead. He stood quite still while Bellah
      scrambled up, then he started off, his pace growing quicker and quicker,
      till at length the girl could hardly see the trees and houses as they
      flashed past. But, rapid as the pace was, it was not rapid enough for
      Bellah, who stooped and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The swallow is less swift than the wind, the wind is less swift than the
      lightning. But you, my horse, if you love me, must be swifter than them
      all, for there is a part of my heart that suffers&mdash;the best part of
      my heart that is in danger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And the horse heard her, and galloped like a straw carried along by a
      tempest till they reached the foot of a rock called the Leap of the Deer.
      There he stopped, for no horse or mule that ever was born could climb that
      rock, and Bellah knew it, so she began to sing again:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Horse of Leon, given to me,
         Over the earth and over the sea,
     Up in the air be guide to me,
         Everywhere to wander free,
</pre>
    <p>
      and when she had finished, the horse&rsquo;s fore legs grew shorter and spread
      into wings, his hind legs became claws, feathers sprouted all over his
      body, and she sat on the back of a great bird, which bore her to the
      summit of the rock. Here she found a nest made of clay and lined with
      dried moss, and in the centre a tiny man, black and wrinkled, who gave a
      cry of surprise at the sight of Bellah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you are the pretty girl who was to come and save me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To save you!&rsquo; repeated Bellah. &lsquo;But who are you, my little friend?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am the husband of the Groac&rsquo;h of the isle of Lok, and it is owing to
      her that I am here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what are you doing in this nest?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sitting on six eggs of stone, and I shall not be set free till they
      are hatched.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this Bellah began to laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor little cock!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and how am I to deliver you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By delivering Houarn, who is in the power of the Groac&rsquo;h.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! tell me how I can manage that, and if I have to walk round the whole
      of Brittany on my bended knees I will do it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, first you must dress yourself as a young man, and then go and seek
      the Groac&rsquo;h. When you have found her you must contrive to get hold of the
      net of steel that hangs from her waist, and shut her up in it for ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But where am I to find a young man&rsquo;s clothes?&rsquo; asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will show you,&rsquo; he replied, and as he spoke he pulled out three of his
      red hairs and blew them away, muttering something the while. In the
      twinkling of an eye the four hairs changed into four tailors, of whom the
      first carried a cabbage, the second a pair of scissors, the third a
      needle, and the fourth an iron. Without waiting for orders, they sat down
      in the nest and, crossing their legs comfortably, began to prepare the
      suit of clothes for Bellah.
    </p>
    <p>
      With one of the leaves of the cabbage they made her a coat, and another
      served for a waistcoat; but it took two for the wide breeches which were
      then in fashion. The hat was cut from the heart of the cabbage, and a pair
      of shoes from the thick stem. And when Bellah had put them all on you
      would have taken her for a gentleman dressed in green velvet, lined with
      white satin.
    </p>
    <p>
      She thanked the little men gratefully, and after a few more instructions,
      jumped on the back of her great bird, and was borne away to the isle of
      Lok. Once there, she bade him transform himself back into a stick, and
      with it in her hand she stepped into the blue boat, which conducted her to
      the palace of shells.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Groac&rsquo;h seemed overjoyed to see her, and told her that never before
      had she beheld such a handsome young man. Very soon she led her visitor
      into the great hall, where wine and fruit were always waiting, and on the
      table lay the magic knife, left there by Houarn. Unseen by the Groac&rsquo;h,
      Bellah hid it in a pocket of her green coat, and then followed her hostess
      into the garden, and to the pond which contained the fish, their sides
      shining with a thousand different colours.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! what beautiful, beautiful creatures!&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure I should
      never be tired of watching them.&rsquo; And she sat down on the bank, with her
      elbows on her knees and her chin in her hands, her eyes fixed on the
      fishes as they flashed past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you not like to stay here always?&rsquo; asked the Groac&rsquo;h; and Bellah
      answered that she desired nothing better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you have only to marry me,&rsquo; said the Groac&rsquo;h. &lsquo;Oh! don&rsquo;t say no, for
      I have fallen deeply in love with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t say &ldquo;No,&rdquo;&rsquo; replied Bellah, with a laugh, &lsquo;but you must
      promise first to let me catch one of those lovely fish in your net.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not so easy as it looks,&rsquo; rejoined the Groac&rsquo;h, smiling, &lsquo;but take
      it, and try your luck.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bellah took the net which the Groac&rsquo;h held out, and, turning rapidly,
      flung it over the witch&rsquo;s head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Become in body what you are in soul!&rsquo; cried she, and in an instant the
      lovely fairy of the sea was a toad, horrible to look upon. She struggled
      hard to tear the net asunder, but it was no use. Bellah only drew it the
      tighter, and, flinging the sorceress into a pit, she rolled a great stone
      across the mouth, and left her.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she drew near the pond she saw a great procession of fishes advancing
      to meet her, crying in hoarse tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is our lord and master, who has saved us from the net of steel and
      the pot of gold!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And who will restore you to your proper shapes,&rsquo; said Bellah, drawing the
      knife from her pocket. But just as she was going to touch the foremost
      fish, her eyes fell on a green frog on his knees beside her, his little
      paws crossed over his little heart. Bellah felt as if fingers were
      tightening round her throat, but she managed to cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this you, my Houarn? Is this you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is I,&rsquo; croaked the little frog; and as the knife touched him he was a
      man again, and, springing up, he clasped her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But we must not forget the others,&rsquo; she said at last, and began to
      transform the fishes to their proper shapes. There were so many of them
      that it took quite a long time. Just as she had finished there arrived the
      little dwarf from the Deer&rsquo;s Leap in a car drawn by six cockchafers, which
      once had been the six stone eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here I am!&rsquo; he exclaimed. &lsquo;You have broken the spell that held me, and
      now come and get your reward,&rsquo; and, dismounting from his chariot, he led
      them down into the caves filled with gold and jewels, and bade Bellah and
      Houarn take as much as they wanted.
    </p>
    <p>
      When their pockets were full, Bellah ordered her stick to become a winged
      carriage, large enough to bear them and the men they had rescued back to
      Lanillis.
    </p>
    <p>
      There they were married the next day, but instead of setting up
      housekeeping with the little cow and pig to fatten that they had so long
      wished for, they were able to buy lands for miles round for themselves,
      and gave each man who had been delivered from the Groac&rsquo;h a small farm,
      where he lived happily to the end of his days.
    </p>
    <p>
      From &lsquo;Le Foyer Breton,&rsquo; par E. Souvestre.

    <h2>
      The Escape of the Mouse
    </h2>
    <p>
      Manawyddan the prince and his friend Pryderi were wanderers, for the
      brother of Manawyddan had been slain, and his throne taken from him. Very
      sorrowful was Manawyddan, but Pryderi was stout of heart, and bade him be
      of good cheer, as he knew a way out of his trouble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what may that be?&rsquo; asked Manawyddan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is that thou marry my mother Rhiannon and become lord of the fair
      lands that I will give her for dowry. Never did any lady have more wit
      than she, and in her youth none was more lovely; even yet she is good to
      look upon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou art the best friend that ever a man had,&rsquo; said Manawyddan. &lsquo;Let us
      go now to seek Rhiannon, and the lands where she dwells.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they set forth, but the news of their coming ran swifter still, and
      Rhiannon and Kieva, wife of Pryderi, made haste to prepare a feast for
      them. And Manawyddan found that Pryderi had spoken the truth concerning
      his mother, and asked if she would take him for her husband. Right gladly
      did she consent, and without delay they were married, and rode away to the
      hunt, Rhiannon and Manawyddan, Kieva and Pryderi, and they would not be
      parted from each other by night or by day, so great was the love between
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, when they were returned, they were sitting out in a green place,
      and suddenly the crash of thunder struck loudly on their ears, and a wall
      of mist fell between them, so that they were hidden one from the other.
      Trembling they sat till the darkness fled and the light shone again upon
      them, but in the place where they were wont to see cattle, and herds, and
      dwellings, they beheld neither house nor beast, nor man nor smoke; neither
      was any one remaining in the green place save these four only.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whither have they gone, and my host also?&rsquo; cried Manawyddan, and they
      searched the hall, and there was no man, and the castle, and there was
      none, and in the dwellings that were left was nothing save wild beasts.
      For a year these four fed on the meat that Manawyddan and Pryderi killed
      out hunting, and the honey of the bees that sucked the mountain heather.
      For a time they desired nothing more, but when the next year began they
      grew weary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We cannot spend our lives thus,&rsquo; said Manawyddan at last, &lsquo;let us go into
      England and learn some trade by which we may live.&rsquo; So they left Wales,
      and went to Hereford, and there they made saddles, while Manawyddan
      fashioned blue enamel ornaments to put on their trappings. And so greatly
      did the townsfolk love these saddles, that no others were bought
      throughout the whole of Hereford, till the saddlers banded together and
      resolved to slay Manawyddan and his companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Pryderi heard of it, he was very wroth, and wished to stay and fight.
      But the counsels of Manawyddan prevailed, and they moved by night to
      another city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What craft shall we follow?&rsquo; asked Pryderi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will make shields,&rsquo; answered Manawyddan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But do we know anything of that craft?&rsquo; answered Pryderi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will try it,&rsquo; said Manawyddan, and they began to make shields, and
      fashioned them after the shape of the shields they had seen; and these
      likewise they enamelled. And so greatly did they prosper that no man in
      the town bought a shield except they had made it, till at length the
      shield-makers banded together as the saddlers had done, and resolved to
      slay them. But of this they had warning, and by night betook themselves to
      another town.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let us take to making shoes,&rsquo; said Manawyddan, &lsquo;for there are not any
      among the shoemakers bold enough to fight us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know nothing of making shoes,&rsquo; answered Pryderi, who in truth despised
      so peaceful a craft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I know,&rsquo; replied Manawyddan, &lsquo;and I will teach thee to stitch. We
      will buy the leather ready dressed, and will make the shoes from it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then straightway he sought the town for the best leather, and for a
      goldsmith to fashion the clasps, and he himself watched till it was done,
      so that he might learn for himself. Soon he became known as &lsquo;The Maker of
      Gold Shoes,&rsquo; and prospered so greatly, that as long as one could be bought
      from him not a shoe was purchased from the shoemakers of the town. And the
      craftsmen were wroth, and banded together to slay them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pryderi,&rsquo; said Manawyddan, when he had received news of it, &lsquo;we will not
      remain in England any longer. Let us set forth to Dyved.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they journeyed until they came to their lands at Narberth. There they
      gathered their dogs round them, and hunted for a year as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      After that a strange thing happened. One morning Pryderi and Manawyddan
      rose up to hunt, and loosened their dogs, which ran before them, till they
      came to a small bush. At the bush, the dogs shrank away as if frightened,
      and returned to their masters, their hair brisling on their backs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must see what is in that bush,&rsquo; said Pryderi, and what was in it was a
      boar, with a skin as white as the snow on the mountains. And he came out,
      and made a stand as the dogs rushed on him, driven on by the men. Long he
      stood at bay; then at last he betook himself to flight, and fled to a
      castle which was newly built, in a place where no building had ever been
      known. Into the castle he ran, and the dogs after him, and long though
      their masters looked and listened, they neither saw nor heard aught
      concerning dogs or boar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will go into the castle and get tidings of the dogs,&rsquo; said Pryderi at
      last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Truly,&rsquo; answered Manawyddan, &lsquo;thou wouldst do unwisely, for whosoever has
      cast a spell over this land has set this castle here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot give up my dogs,&rsquo; replied Pryderi, and to the castle he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      But within was neither man nor beast; neither boar nor dogs, but only a
      fountain with marble round it, and on the edge a golden bowl, richly
      wrought, which pleased Pryderi greatly. In a moment he forgot about his
      dogs, and went up to the bowl and took hold of it, and his hands stuck to
      the bowl, and his feet to the marble slab, and despair took possession of
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Till the close of day Manawyddan waited for him, and when the sun was fast
      sinking, he went home, thinking that he had strayed far.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where are thy friend and thy dogs?&rsquo; said Rhiannon, and he told her what
      had befallen Pryderi.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A good friend hast thou lost,&rsquo; answered Rhiannon, and she went up to the
      castle and through the gate, which was open. There, in the centre of the
      courtyard, she beheld Pryderi standing, and hastened towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What dost thou here?&rsquo; she asked, laying her hand on the bowl, and as she
      spoke she too stuck fast, and was not able to utter a word. Then thunder
      was heard and a veil of darkness descended upon them, and the castle
      vanished and they with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Kieva, the wife of Pryderi, found that neither her husband nor his
      mother returned to her, she was in such sorrow that she cared not whether
      she lived or died. Manawyddan was grieved also in his heart, and said to
      her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not fitting that we should stay here, for he have lost our dogs and
      cannot get food. Let us go into England&mdash;it is easier for us to live
      there.&rsquo; So they set forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What craft wilt thou follow?&rsquo; asked Kieva as they went along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall make shoes as once I did,&rsquo; replied he; and he got all the finest
      leather in the town and caused gilded clasps to be made for the shoes,
      till everyone flocked to buy, and all the shoemakers in the town were idle
      and banded together in anger to kill him. But luckily Manawyddan got word
      of it, and he and Kieva left the town one night and proceeded to Narberth,
      taking with him a sheaf of wheat, which he sowed in three plots of ground.
      And while the wheat was growing up, he hunted and fished, and they had
      food enough and to spare. Thus the months passed until the harvest; and
      one evening Manawyddan visited the furthest of his fields of wheat; and
      saw that it was ripe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow I will reap this,&rsquo; said he; but on the morrow when he went to
      reap the wheat he found nothing but the bare straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Filled with dismay he hastened to the second field, and there the corn was
      ripe and golden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow I will reap this,&rsquo; he said, but on the morrow the ears had
      gone, and there was nothing but the bare straw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, there is still one field left,&rsquo; he said, and when he looked at it,
      it was still fairer than the other two. &lsquo;To-night I will watch here,&rsquo; 
      thought he, &lsquo;for whosoever carried off the other corn will in like manner
      take this, and I will know who it is.&rsquo; So he hid himself and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hours slid by, and all was still, so still that Manawyddan well-nigh
      dropped asleep. But at midnight there arose the loudest tumult in the
      world, and peeping out he beheld a mighty host of mice, which could
      neither be numbered nor measured. Each mouse climbed up a straw till it
      bent down with its weight, and then it bit off one of the ears, and
      carried it away, and there was not one of the straws that had not got a
      mouse to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of wrath he rushed at the mice, but he could no more come up with
      them than if they had been gnats, or birds of the air, save one only which
      lingered behind the rest, and this mouse Manawyddan came up with. Stooping
      down he seized it by the tail, and put it in his glove, and tied a piece
      of string across the opening of the glove, so that the mouse could not
      escape. When he entered the hall where Kieva was sitting, he lighted a
      fire, and hung the glove up on a peg.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What hast thou there?&rsquo; asked she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A thief,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;that I caught robbing me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What kind of a thief may it be which thou couldst put in thy glove?&rsquo; said
      Kieva.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I will tell thee,&rsquo; he replied, and then he showed her how his fields
      of corn had been wasted, and how he had watched for the mice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And one was less nimble than the rest, and is now in my glove. To-morrow
      I will hang it, and I only wish I had them all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a marvel, truly,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;yet it would be unseemly for a man of
      thy dignity to hang a reptile such as this. Do not meddle with it, but let
      it go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Woe betide me,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;if I would not hang them all if I could catch
      them, and such as I have I will hang.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Verily,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;there is no reason I should succour this reptile,
      except to prevent discredit unto thee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I knew any cause that I should succour it, I would take thy counsel,&rsquo; 
      answered Manawyddan, &lsquo;but as I know of none, I am minded to destroy it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do so then,&rsquo; said Kieva.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he went up a hill and set up two forks on the top, and while he was
      doing this he saw a scholar coming towards him, whose clothes were
      tattered. Now it was seven years since Manawyddan had seen man or beast in
      that place, and the sight amazed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good day to thee, my lord,&rsquo; said the scholar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good greeting to thee, scholar. Whence dost thou come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From singing in England; but wherefore dost thou ask?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because for seven years no man hath visited this place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wander where I will,&rsquo; answered the scholar. &lsquo;And what work art thou
      upon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am about to hang a thief that I caught robbing me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What manner of thief is that?&rsquo; inquired the scholar. &lsquo;I see a creature in
      thy hand like upon a mouse, and ill does it become a man of thy rank to
      touch a reptile like this. Let it go free.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not let it go free,&rsquo; cried Manawyddan. &lsquo;I caught it robbing me,
      and it shall suffer the doom of a thief.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord!&rsquo; said the scholar, &lsquo;sooner than see a man like thee at such a work,
      I would give thee a pound which I have received as alms to let it go
      free.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not let it go free, neither will I sell it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As thou wilt, lord,&rsquo; answered the scholar, and he went his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Manawyddan was placing the cross-beam on the two forked sticks, where the
      mouse was to hang, when a priest rode past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-day to thee, lord; and what art thou doing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am hanging a thief that I caught robbing me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What manner of thief, lord?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A creature in the form of a mouse. It has been robbing me, and it shall
      suffer the doom of a thief.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord,&rsquo; said the priest, &lsquo;sooner than see thee touch this reptile, I would
      purchase its freedom.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will neither sell it nor set it free.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is true that a mouse is worth nothing, but rather than see thee defile
      thyself with touching such a reptile as this, I will give thee three
      pounds for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not take any price for it. It shall be hanged as it deserves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Willingly, my lord, if it is thy pleasure.&rsquo; And the priest went his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Manawyddan noosed the string about the mouse&rsquo;s neck, and was about to
      draw it tight when a bishop, with a great following and horses bearing
      huge packs, came by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What work art thou upon?&rsquo; asked the bishop, drawing rein.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hanging a thief that I caught robbing me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But is not that a mouse that I see in thine hand?&rsquo; asked the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; that is the thief,&rsquo; answered Manawyddan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, since I have come at the doom of this reptile, I will ransom it of
      thee for seven pounds, rather than see a man of thy rank touch it. Loose
      it, and let it go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not let it loose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will give thee four and twenty pounds to set it free,&rsquo; said the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not set it free for as much again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If thou wilt not set it free for this, I will give thee all the horses
      thou seest and the seven loads of baggage.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not set it free.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then tell me at what price thou wilt loose it, and I will give it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The spell must be taken off Rhiannon and Pryderi,&rsquo; said Manawyddan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That shall be done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But not yet will I loose the mouse. The charm that has been cast over all
      my lands must be taken off likewise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This shall be done also.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But not yet will I loose the mouse till I know who she is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is my wife,&rsquo; answered the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And wherefore came she to me?&rsquo; asked Manawyddan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To despoil thee,&rsquo; replied the bishop, &lsquo;for it is I who cast the charm
      over thy lands, to avenge Gwawl the son of Clud my friend. And it was I
      who threw the spell upon Pryderi to avenge Gwawl for the trick that had
      been played on him in the game of Badger in the Bag. And not only was I
      wroth, but my people likewise, and when it was known that thou wast come
      to dwell in the land, they besought me much to change them into mice, that
      they might eat thy corn. The first and the second nights it was the men of
      my own house that destroyed thy two fields, but on the third night my wife
      and her ladies came to me and begged me to change them also into the shape
      of mice, that they might take part in avenging Gwawl. Therefore I changed
      them. Yet had she not been ill and slow of foot, thou couldst not have
      overtaken her. Still, since she was caught, I will restore thee Pryderi
      and Rhiannon, and will take the charm from off thy lands. I have told thee
      who she is; so now set her free.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not set her free,&rsquo; answered Manawyddan, &lsquo;till thou swear that no
      vengeance shall be taken for his, either upon Pryderi, or upon Rhiannon,
      or on me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will grant thee this boon; and thou hast done wisely to ask it, for on
      thy head would have lit all the trouble. Set now my wife free.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not set her free till Pryderi and Rhiannon are with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Behold, here they come,&rsquo; said the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Manawyddan held out his hands and greeted Pryderi and Rhiannon, and
      they seated themselves joyfully on the grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, lord, hast thou not received all thou didst ask?&rsquo; said the bishop.
      &lsquo;Set now my wife free!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I will gladly,&rsquo; answered Manawyddan, unloosing the cord from her
      neck, and as he did so the bishop struck her with his staff, and she
      turned into a young woman, the fairest that ever was seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look around upon thy land,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and thou wilt see it all tilled and
      peopled, as it was long ago.&rsquo; And Manawyddan looked, and saw corn growing
      in the fields, and cows and sheep grazing on the hill-side, and huts for
      the people to dwell in. And he was satisfied in his soul, but one more
      question he put to the bishop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What spell didst thou lay upon Pryderi and Rhiannon?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pryderi has had the knockers of the gate of my palace hung about him, and
      Rhiannon has carried the collars of my asses around her neck,&rsquo; said the
      bishop with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the &lsquo;Mabinogion.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      The Believing Husbands
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once upon a time there dwelt in the land of Erin a young man who was
      seeking a wife, and of all the maidens round about none pleased him as
      well as the only daughter of a farmer. The girl was willing and the father
      was willing, and very soon they were married and went to live at the farm.
      By and bye the season came when they must cut the peats and pile them up
      to dry, so that they might have fires in the winter. So on a fine day the
      girl and her husband, and the father and his wife all went out upon the
      moor.
    </p>
    <p>
      They worked hard for many hours, and at length grew hungry, so the young
      woman was sent home to bring them food, and also to give the horses their
      dinner. When she went into the stables, she suddenly saw the heavy
      pack-saddle of the speckled mare just over her head, and she jumped and
      said to herself:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose that pack-saddle were to fall and kill me, how dreadful it would
      be!&rsquo; and she sat down just under the pack-saddle she was so much afraid
      of, and began to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the others out on the moor grew hungrier and hungrier.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What can have become of her?&rsquo; asked they, and at length the mother
      declared that she would wait no longer, and must go and see what had
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the bride was nowhere in the kitchen or the dairy, the old woman went
      into the stable, where she found her daughter weeping bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter, my dove?&rsquo; and the girl answered, between her sobs:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I came in and saw the pack-saddle over my head, I thought how
      dreadful it would be if it fell and killed me,&rsquo; and she cried louder than
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old woman struck her hands together: &lsquo;Ah, to think of it! if that were
      to be, what should I do?&rsquo; and she sat down by her daughter, and they both
      wrung their hands and let their tears flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something strange must have occurred,&rsquo; exclaimed the old farmer on the
      moor, who by this time was not only hungry, but cross. &lsquo;I must go after
      them.&rsquo; And he went and found them in the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; replied his wife, &lsquo;when our daughter came home, did she not see the
      pack-saddle over her head, and she thought how dreadful it would be if it
      were to fall and kill her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, to think of it!&rsquo; exclaimed he, striking his hands together, and he
      sat down beside them and wept too.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as night fell the young man returned full of hunger, and there
      they were, all crying together in the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter?&rsquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When thy wife came home,&rsquo; answered the farmer, &lsquo;she saw the pack-saddle
      over her head, and she thought how dreadful it would be if it were to fall
      and kill her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, but it didn&rsquo;t fall,&rsquo; replied the young man, and he went off to the
      kitchen to get some supper, leaving them to cry as long as they liked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he got up with the sun, and said to the old man and to
      the old woman and to his wife:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Farewell: my foot shall not return to the house till I have found other
      three people as silly as you,&rsquo; and he walked away till he came to the
      town, and seeing the door of a cottage standing open wide, he entered. No
      man was present, but only some women spinning at their wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not belong to this town,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You speak truth,&rsquo; they answered, &lsquo;nor you either?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not,&rsquo; replied he, &lsquo;but is it a good place to live in?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The women looked at each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The men of the town are so silly that we can make them believe anything
      we please,&rsquo; said they.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, here is a gold ring,&rsquo; replied he, &lsquo;and I will give it to the one
      amongst you who can make her husband believe the most impossible thing,&rsquo; 
      and he left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the first husband came home his wife said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou art sick!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I?&rsquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, thou art,&rsquo; she answered; &lsquo;take off thy clothes and lie down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So he did, and when he was in his bed his wife went to him and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou art dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, am I?&rsquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thou art,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;shut thine eyes and stir neither hand nor foot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And dead he felt sure he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the second man came home, and his wife said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not my husband!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, am I not?&rsquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it is not you,&rsquo; answered she, so he went away and slept in the wood.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the third man arrived his wife gave him his supper, and after that he
      went to bed, just as usual. The next morning a boy knocked at the door,
      bidding him attend the burial of the man who was dead, and he was just
      going to get up when his wife stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Time enough,&rsquo; said she, and he lay still till he heard the funeral
      passing the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now rise, and be quick,&rsquo; called the wife, and the man jumped out of bed
      in a great hurry, and began to look about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, where are my clothes?&rsquo; asked he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silly that you are, they are on your back, of course,&rsquo; answered the
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are they?&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;and make haste lest the burying be ended before you
      get there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then off he went, running hard, and when the mourners saw a man coming
      towards them with nothing on but his nightshirt, they forgot in their
      fright what they were there for, and fled to hide themselves. And the
      naked man stood alone at the head of the coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very soon a man came out of the wood and spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; answered the naked man. &lsquo;I do not know you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why are you naked?&rsquo; asked the first man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I naked? My wife told me that I had all my clothes on,&rsquo; answered he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And my wife told me that I myself was dead,&rsquo; said the man in the coffin.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at the sound of his voice the two men were so terrified that they ran
      straight home, and the man in the coffin got up and followed them, and it
      was his wife that gained the gold ring, as he had been sillier than the
      other two.

    <h2>
      The Hoodie-Crow.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once there lived a farmer who had three daughters, and good useful girls
      they were, up with the sun, and doing all the work of the house. One
      morning they all ran down to the river to wash their clothes, when a
      hoodie came round and sat on a tree close by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wilt thou wed me, thou farmer&rsquo;s daughter?&rsquo; he said to the eldest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed I won&rsquo;t wed thee,&rsquo; she answered, &lsquo;an ugly brute is the hoodie.&rsquo; 
      And the bird, much offended, spread his wings and flew away. But the
      following day he came back again, and said to the second girl:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wilt thou wed me, farmer&rsquo;s daughter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed I will not,&rsquo; answered she, &lsquo;an ugly brute is the hoodie.&rsquo; And the
      hoodie was more angry than before, and went away in a rage. However, after
      a night&rsquo;s rest he was in a better temper, and thought that he might be
      more lucky the third time, so back he went to the old place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wilt thou wed me, farmer&rsquo;s daughter?&rsquo; he said to the youngest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed I will wed thee; a pretty creature is the hoodie,&rsquo; answered she,
      and on the morrow they were married.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have something to ask thee,&rsquo; said the hoodie when they were far away in
      his own house. &lsquo;Wouldst thou rather I should be a hoodie by day and a man
      by night, or a man by day and a hoodie by night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was surprised at his words, for she did not know that he could be
      anything but a hoodie at all times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still she said nothing of this, and only replied, &lsquo;I would rather thou
      wert a man by day and a hoodie by night,&rsquo; And so he was; and a handsomer
      man or a more beautiful hoodie never was seen. The girl loved them both,
      and never wished for things to be different.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and bye they had a son, and very pleased they both were. But in the
      night soft music was heard stealing close towards the house, and every man
      slept, and the mother slept also. When they woke again it was morning, and
      the baby was gone. High and low they looked for it, but nowhere could they
      find it, and the farmer, who had come to see his daughter, was greatly
      grieved, as he feared it might be thought that he had stolen it, because
      he did not want the hoodie for a son-in-law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next year the hoodie&rsquo;s wife had another son, and this time a watch was
      set at every door. But it was no use. In vain they determined that, come
      what might, they would not close their eyes; at the first note of music
      they all fell asleep, and when the farmer arrived in the morning to see
      his grandson, he found them all weeping, for while they had slept the baby
      had vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, the next year it all happened again, and the hoodie&rsquo;s wife was so
      unhappy that her husband resolved to take her away to another house he
      had, and her sisters with her for company. So they set out in a coach
      which was big enough to hold them, and had not gone very far when the
      hoodie suddenly said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are sure you have not forgotten anything?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have forgotten my coarse comb,&rsquo; answered the wife, feeling in her
      pocket, and as she spoke the coach changed into a withered faggot, and the
      man became a hoodie again, and flew away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two sisters returned home, but the wife followed the hoodie. Sometimes
      she would see him on a hill-top, and then would hasten after him, hoping
      to catch him. But by the time she had got to the top of the hill, he would
      be in the valley on the other side. When night came, and she was tired,
      she looked about for some place to rest, and glad she was to see a little
      house full of light straight in front of her, and she hurried towards it
      as fast as she could.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door stood a little boy, and the sight of him filled her heart with
      pleasure, she did not know why. A woman came out, and bade her welcome,
      and set before her food, and gave her a soft bed to lie on. And the
      hoodie&rsquo;s wife lay down, and so tired was she, that it seemed to her but a
      moment before the sun rose, and she awoke again. From hill to hill she
      went after the hoodie, and sometimes she saw him on the top; but when she
      got to the top, he had flown into the valley, and when she reached the
      valley he was on the top of another hill&mdash;and so it happened till
      night came round again. Then she looked round for some place to rest in,
      and she beheld a little house of light before her, and fast she hurried
      towards it. At the door stood a little boy, and her heart was filled with
      pleasure at the sight of him, she did not know why. After that a woman
      bade her enter, and set food before her, and gave her a soft bed to lie
      in. And when the sun rose she got up, and left the house, in search of the
      hoodie. This day everything befell as on the two other days, but when she
      reached the small house, the woman bade her keep awake, and if the hoodie
      flew into the room, to try to seize him.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the wife had walked far, and was very tired, and strive as she would,
      she fell sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many hours she slept, and the hoodie entered through a window, and let
      fall a ring on her hand. The girl awoke with a start, and leant forward to
      grasp him, but he was already flying off, and she only seized a feather
      from his wing. And when dawn came, she got up and told the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has gone over the hill of poison,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;and there you cannot
      follow him without horse-shoes on your hands and feet. But I will help
      you. Put on this suit of men&rsquo;s clothes, and go down this road till you
      come to the smithy, and there you can learn to make horse-shoes for
      yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl thanked her, and put on the cloths and went down the road to do
      her bidding. So hard did she work, that in a few days she was able to make
      the horse-shoes. Early one morning she set out for the hill of poison. On
      her hands and feet she went, but even with the horse-shoes on she had to
      be very careful not to stumble, lest some poisoned thorns should enter
      into her flesh, and she should die. But when at last she was over, it was
      only to hear that her husband was to be married that day to the daughter
      of a great lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there was to be a race in the town, and everyone meant to be there,
      except the stranger who had come over the hill of poison&mdash;everyone,
      that is, but the cook, who was to make the bridal supper. Greatly he loved
      races, and sore was his heart to think that one should be run without his
      seeing it, so when he beheld a woman whom he did not know coming along the
      street, hope sprang up in him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you cook the wedding feast in place of me?&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and I will pay
      you well when I return from the race.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Gladly she agreed, and cooked the feast in a kitchen that looked into the
      great hall, where the company were to eat it. After that she watched the
      seat where the bridegroom was sitting, and taking a plateful of the broth,
      she dropped the ring and the feather into it, and set if herself before
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the first spoonful he took up the ring, and a thrill ran through him;
      in the second he beheld the feather and rose from his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who has cooked this feast?&rsquo; asked he, and the real cook, who had come
      back from the race, was brought before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He may be the cook, but he did not cook this feast,&rsquo; said the bridegroom,
      and then inquiry was made, and the girl was summoned to the great hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is my married wife,&rsquo; he declared, &lsquo;and no one else will I have,&rsquo; and
      at that very moment the spells fell off him, and never more would he be a
      hoodie. Happy indeed were they to be together again, and little did they
      mind that the hill of poison took long to cross, for she had to go some
      way forwards, and then throw the horse-shoes back for him to put on.
      Still, at last they were over, and they went back the way she had come,
      and stopped at the three houses in order to take their little sons to
      their own home.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the story never says who had stolen them, nor what the coarse comb had
      to do with it.

    <h2>
      The Brownie of the Lake
    </h2>
    <p>
      Once upon a time there lived in France a man whose name was Jalm Riou. You
      might have walked a whole day without meeting anyone happier or more
      contented, for he had a large farm, plenty of money, and above all, a
      daughter called Barbaik, the most graceful dancer and the best-dressed
      girl in the whole country side. When she appeared on holidays in her
      embroidered cap, five petticoats, each one a little shorter than the
      other, and shoes with silver buckles, the women were all filled with envy,
      but little cared Barbaik what they might whisper behind her back as long
      as she knew that her clothes were finer than anyone else&rsquo;s and that she
      had more partners than any other girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now amongst all the young men who wanted to marry Barbaik, the one whose
      heart was most set on her was her father&rsquo;s head man, but as his manners
      were rough and he was exceedingly ugly she would have nothing to say to
      him, and, what was worse, often made fun of him with the rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jegu, for that was his name, of course heard of this, and it made him very
      unhappy. Still he would not leave the farm, and look for work elsewhere,
      as he might have done, for then he would never see Barbaik at all, and
      what was life worth to him without that?
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening he was bringing back his horses from the fields, and stopped
      at a little lake on the way home to let them drink. He was tired with a
      long day&rsquo;s work, and stood with his hand on the mane of one of the
      animals, waiting till they had done, and thinking all the while of
      Barbaik, when a voice came out of the gorse close by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is the matter, Jegu? You mustn&rsquo;t despair yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man glanced up in surprise, and asked who was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is I, the brownie of the lake,&rsquo; replied the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But where are you?&rsquo; inquired Jegu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look close, and you will see me among the reeds in the form of a little
      green frog. I can take,&rsquo; he added proudly, &lsquo;any shape I choose, and even,
      which is much harder, be invisible if I want to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then show yourself to me in the shape in which your family generally
      appear,&rsquo; replied Jegu.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, if you wish,&rsquo; and the frog jumped on the back of one of the
      horses, and changed into a little dwarf, all dressed in green.
    </p>
    <p>
      This transformation rather frightened Jegu, but the brownie bade him have
      no fears, for he would not do him any harm; indeed, he hoped that Jegu
      might find him of some use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why should you take all this interest in me?&rsquo; asked the peasant
      suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because of a service you did me last winter, which I have never
      forgotten,&rsquo; answered the little fellow. &lsquo;You know, I am sure, that the
      korigans[FN#3: The spiteful fairies.] who dwell in the White Corn country
      have declared war on my people, because they say that they are the friends
      of man. We were therefore obliged to take refuge in distant lands, and to
      hide ourselves at first under different animal shapes. Since that time,
      partly from habit and partly to amuse ourselves, we have continued to
      transform ourselves, and it was in this way that I got to know you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How?&rsquo; exclaimed Jegu, filled with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you remember when you were digging in the field near the river, three
      months ago, you found a robin redbreast caught in a net?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; answered Jegu, &lsquo;I remember it very well, and I opened the net and
      let him go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I was that robin redbreast, and ever since I have vowed to be your
      friend, and as you want to marry Barbaik, I will prove the truth of what I
      say by helping you to do so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! my little brownie, if you can do that, there is nothing I won&rsquo;t give
      you, except my soul.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then let me alone,&rsquo; rejoined the dwarf, &lsquo;and I promise you that in a very
      few months you shall be master of the farm and of Barbaik.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But how are you going to do it?&rsquo; exclaimed Jegu wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is my affair. Perhaps I may tell you later. Meanwhile you just eat
      and sleep, and don&rsquo;t worry yourself about anything.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jegu declared that nothing could be easier, and then taking off his hat,
      he thanked the dwarf heartily, and led his horses back to the farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning was a holiday, and Barbaik was awake earlier than usual, as
      she wished to get through her work as soon as possible, and be ready to
      start for a dance which was to be held some distance off. She went first
      to the cow-house, which it was her duty to keep clean, but to her
      amazement she found fresh straw put down, the racks filled with hay, the
      cows milked, and the pails standing neatly in a row.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, Jegu must have done this in the hope of my giving him a
      dance,&rsquo; she thought to herself, and when she met him outside the door she
      stopped and thanked him for his help. To be sure, Jegu only replied
      roughly that he didn&rsquo;t know what she was talking about, but this answer
      made her feel all the more certain that it was he and nobody else.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same thing took place every day, and never had the cow-house been so
      clean nor the cows so fat. Morning and evening Barbaik found her earthen
      pots full of milk and a pound of butter freshly churned, ornamented with
      leaves. At the end of a few weeks she grew so used to this state of
      affairs that she only got up just in time to prepare breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon even this grew to be unnecessary, for a day arrived when, coming
      downstairs, she discovered that the house was swept, the furniture
      polished, the fire lit, and the food ready, so that she had nothing to do
      except to ring the great bell which summoned the labourers from the fields
      to come and eat it. This, also, she thought was the work of Jegu, and she
      could not help feeling that a husband of this sort would be very useful to
      a girl who liked to lie in bed and to amuse herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, Barbaik had only to express a wish for it to be satisfied. If the
      wind was cold or the sun was hot and she was afraid to go out lest her
      complexion should be spoilt, she need only to run down to the spring close
      by and say softly, &lsquo;I should like my churns to be full, and my wet linen
      to be stretched on the hedge to dry,&rsquo; and she need never give another
      thought to the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she found the rye bread too hard to bake, or the oven taking too long
      to heat, she just murmured, &lsquo;I should like to see my six loaves on the
      shelf above the bread box,&rsquo; and two hours after there they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she was too lazy to walk all the way to market along a dirty road, she
      would say out loud the night before, &lsquo;Why am I not already back from
      Morlaix with my milk pot empty, my butter bowl inside it, a pound of wild
      cherries on my wooden plate, and the money I have gained in my apron
      pocket?&rsquo; and in the morning when she got up, lo and behold! there were
      standing at the foot of her bed the empty milk pot with the butter bowl
      inside, the black cherries on the wooden plate, and six new pieces of
      silver in the pocket of her apron. And she believed that all this was
      owing to Jegu, and she could no longer do without him, even in her
      thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When things had reached this pass, the brownie told the young man that he
      had better ask Barbaik to marry him, and this time the girl did not turn
      rudely away, but listened patiently to the end. In her eyes he was as ugly
      and awkward as ever, but he would certainly make a most useful husband,
      and she could sleep every morning till breakfast time, just like a young
      lady, and as for the rest of the day, it would not be half long enough for
      all she meant to do. She would wear the beautiful dresses that came when
      she wished for them, and visit her neighbours, who would be dying of envy
      all the while, and she would be able to dance as much as she wished. Jegu
      would always be there to work for her and save for her, and watch over
      her. So, like a well-brought-up girl, Barbaik answered that it should be
      as her father pleased, knowing quite well that old Riou had often said
      that after he was dead there was no one so capable of carrying on the
      farm.
    </p>
    <p>
      The marriage took place the following month, and a few days later the old
      man died quite suddenly. Now Jegu had everything to see to himself, and
      somehow it did not seem so easy as when the farmer was alive. But once
      more the brownie stepped in, and was better than ten labourers. It was he
      who ploughed and sowed and reaped, and if, as happened, occasionally, it
      was needful to get the work done quickly, the brownie called in some of
      his friends, and as soon as it was light a host of little dwarfs might
      have been seen in the fields, busy with hoe, fork or sickle. But by the
      time the people were about all was finished, and the little fellows had
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      And all the payment the brownie ever asked for was a bowl of broth. From
      the very day of her marriage Barbaik had noted with surprise and rage that
      things ceased to be done for her as they had been done all the weeks and
      months before. She complained to Jegu of his laziness, and he only stared
      at her, not understanding what she was talking about. But the brownie, who
      was standing by, burst out laughing, and confessed that all the good
      offices she spoke of had been performed by him, for the sake of Jegu, but
      that now he had other business to do, and it was high time that she looked
      after her house herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barbaik was furious. Each morning when she was obliged to get up before
      dawn to milk the cows and go to market, and each evening when she had to
      sit up till midnight in order to churn the butter, her heart was filled
      with rage against the brownie who had caused her to expect a life of ease
      and pleasure. But when she looked at Jegu and beheld his red face,
      squinting eyes, and untidy hair, her anger was doubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it had not been for you, you miserable dwarf!&rsquo; she would say between
      her teeth, &lsquo;if it had not been for you I should never have married that
      man, and I should still have been going to dances, where the young men
      would have brought me present of nuts and cherries, and told me that I was
      the prettiest girl in the parish. While now I can receive no presents
      except from my husband. I can never dance, except with my husband. Oh, you
      wretched dwarf, I will never, never forgive you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of her fierce words, no one knew better than Barbaik how to put
      her pride in her pocket when it suited her, and after receiving an
      invitation to a wedding, she begged the brownie to get her a horse to ride
      there. To her great joy he consented, bidding her set out for the city of
      the dwarfs and to tell them exactly what she wanted. Full of excitement,
      Barbaik started on her journey. It was not long, and when she reached the
      town she went straight to the dwarfs, who were holding counsel in a wide
      green place, and said to them, &lsquo;Listen, my friends! I have come to beg you
      to lend me a black horse, with eyes, a mouth, ears, bridle and saddle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She had hardly spoken when the horse appeared, and mounting on his back
      she started for the village where the wedding was to be held.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first she was so delighted with the chance of a holiday from the work
      which she hated, that she noticed nothing, but very soon it struck her as
      odd that as she passed along the roads full of people they all laughed as
      they looked at her horse. At length she caught some words uttered by one
      man to another. &lsquo;Why, the farmer&rsquo;s wife has sold her horse&rsquo;s tail!&rsquo; and
      turned in her saddle. Yes; it was true. Her horse had no tail! She had
      forgotten to ask for one, and the wicked dwarfs had carried out her orders
      to the letter!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, at any rate, I shall soon be there,&rsquo; she thought, and shaking the
      reins, tried to urge the horse to a gallop. But it was of no use; he
      declined to move out of a walk; and she was forced to hear all the jokes
      that were made upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the evening she returned to the farm more angry than ever, and quite
      determined to revenge herself on the brownie whenever she had the chance,
      which happened to be very soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the spring, and just the time of year when the dwarfs held their
      fete, so one day the brownie asked Jegu if he might bring his friends to
      have supper in the great barn, and whether he would allow them to dance
      there. Of course, Jegu was only too pleased to be able to do anything for
      the brownie, and he ordered Barbaik to spread her best table-cloths in the
      barn, and to make a quantity of little loaves and pancakes, and, besides,
      to keep all the milk given by the cows that morning. He expected she would
      refuse, as he knew she hated the dwarfs, but she said nothing, and
      prepared the supper as he had bidden her.
    </p>
    <p>
      When all was ready, the dwarfs, in new green suits, came bustling in, very
      happy and merry, and took their seats at the table. But in a moment they
      all sprang up with a cry, and ran away screaming, for Barbaik had placed
      pans of hot coals under their feet, and all their poor little toes were
      burnt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t forget that in a hurry,&rsquo; she said, smiling grimly to herself,
      but in a moment they were back again with large pots of water, which they
      poured on the fire. Then they joined hands and danced round it, singing:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          Wicked traitress, Barne Riou,
          Our poor toes are burned by you;
          Now we hurry from your hall&mdash;
          Bad luck light upon you all.
</pre>
    <p>
      That evening they left the country for ever, and Jegu, without their help,
      grew poorer and poorer, and at last died of misery, while Barbaik was glad
      to find work in the market of Morlaix.

      The Winning of Olwen
    </h2>
    <p>
      There was once a king and queen who had a little boy, and they called his
      name Kilweh. The queen, his mother, fell ill soon after his birth, and as
      she could not take care of him herself she sent him to a woman she knew up
      in the mountains, so that he might learn to go out in all weathers, and
      bear heat and cold, and grow tall and strong. Kilweh was quite happy with
      his nurse, and ran races and climbed hills with the children who were his
      playfellows, and in the winter, when the snow lay on the ground, sometimes
      a man with a harp would stop and beg for shelter, and in return would sing
      them songs of strange things that had happened in the years gone by.
    </p>
    <p>
      But long before this changes had taken place in the court of Kilweh&rsquo;s
      father. Soon after she had sent her baby away the queen became much worse,
      and at length, seeing that she was going to die, she called her husband to
      her and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never again shall I rise from this bed, and by and bye thou wilt take
      another wife. But lest she should make thee forget thy son, I charge thee
      that thou take not a wife until thou see a briar with two blossoms upon my
      grave.&rsquo; And this he promised her. Then she further bade him to see to her
      grave that nothing might grow thereon. This likewise he promised her, and
      soon she died, and for seven years the king sent a man every morning to
      see that nothing was growing on the queen&rsquo;s grave, but at the end of seven
      years he forgot.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day when the king was out hunting he rode past the place where the
      queen lay buried, and there he saw a briar growing with two blossoms on
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is time that I took a wife,&rsquo; said he, and after long looking he found
      one. But he did not tell her about his son; indeed he hardly remembered
      that he had one till she heard it at last from an old woman whom she had
      gone to visit. And the new queen was very pleased, and sent messengers to
      fetch the boy, and in his father&rsquo;s court he stayed, while the years went
      by till one day the queen told him that a prophecy had foretold that he
      was to win for his wife Olwen the daughter of Yspaddaden Penkawr.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he heard this Kilweh felt proud and happy. Surely he must be a man
      now, he thought, or there would be no talk of a wife for him, and his mind
      dwelt all day upon his promised bride, and what she would be like when he
      beheld her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What aileth thee, my son?&rsquo; asked his father at last, when Kilweh had
      forgotten something he had been bidden to do, and Kilweh blushed red as he
      answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My stepmother says that none but Olwen, the daughter of Yspaddaden
      Penkawr, shall be my wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That will be easily fulfilled,&rsquo; replied his father. &lsquo;Arthur the king is
      thy cousin. Go therefore unto him and beg him to cut thy hair, and to
      grant thee this boon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the youth pricked forth upon a dapple grey horse of four years old,
      with a bridle of linked gold, and gold upon his saddle. In his hand he
      bore two spears of silver with heads of steel; a war-horn of ivory was
      slung round his shoulder, and by his side hung a golden sword. Before him
      were two brindled white-breasted greyhounds with collars of rubies round
      their necks, and the one that was on the left side bounded across to the
      right side, and the one on the right to the left, and like two
      sea-swallows sported round him. And his horse cast up four sods with his
      four hoofs, like four swallows in the air about his head, now above, now
      below. About him was a robe of purple, and an apple of gold was at each
      corner, and every one of the apples was of the value of a hundred cows.
      And the blades of grass bent not beneath him, so light were his horse&rsquo;s
      feet as he journeyed toward the gate of Arthur&rsquo;s palace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there a porter?&rsquo; cried Kilweh, looking round for someone to open the
      gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is; and I am Arthur&rsquo;s porter every first day of January,&rsquo; answered
      a man coming out to him. &lsquo;The rest of the year there are other porters,
      and among them Pennpingyon, who goes upon his head to save his feet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, open the portal, I say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, that I may not do, for none can enter save the son of a king or a
      pedlar who has goods to sell. But elsewhere there will be food for thy
      dogs and hay for thy horse, and for thee collops cooked and peppered, and
      sweet wine shall be served in the guest chamber.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That will not do for me,&rsquo; answered Kilweh. &lsquo;If thou wilt not open the
      gate I will send up three shouts that shall be heard from Cornwall unto
      the north, and yet again to Ireland.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatsoever clamour thou mayest make,&rsquo; spake Glewlwyd the porter, &lsquo;thou
      shalt not enter until I first go and speak with Arthur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Glewlwyd went into the hall, and Arthur said to him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hast thou news from the gate?&rsquo; and the porter answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Far have I travelled, both in this island and elsewhere, and many kingly
      men have I seen; but never yet have I beheld one equal in majesty to him
      who now stands at the door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If walking thou didst enter here, return thou running,&rsquo; replied Arthur,
      &lsquo;and let everyone that opens and shuts the eye show him respect and serve
      him, for it is not meet to keep such a man in the wind and rain.&rsquo; So
      Glewlwyd unbarred the gate and Kilweh rode in upon his charger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Greeting unto thee, O ruler of this land,&rsquo; cried he, &lsquo;and greeting no
      less to the lowest than to the highest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Greeting to thee also,&rsquo; answered Arthur. &lsquo;Sit thou between two of my
      warriors, and thou shalt have minstrels before thee and all that belongs
      to one born to be a king, while thou remainest in my palace.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not come,&rsquo; replied Kilweh, &lsquo;for meat and drink, but to obtain a
      boon, and if thou grant it me I will pay it back, and will carry thy
      praise to the four winds of heaven. But if thou wilt not grant it to me,
      then I will proclaim thy discourtesy wherever thy name is known.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What thou askest that shalt thou receive,&rsquo; said Arthur, &lsquo;as far as the
      wind dries and the rain moistens, and the sun revolves and the sea
      encircles and the earth extends. Save only my ship and my mantle, my word
      and my lance, my shield and my dagger, and Guinevere my wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would that thou bless my hair,&rsquo; spake Kilweh, and Arthur answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That shall be granted thee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Forthwith he bade his men fetch him a comb of gold and a scissors with
      loops of silver, and he combed the hair of Kilweh his guest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me who thou art,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;for my heart warms to thee, and I feel
      thou art come of my blood.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am Kilweh, son of Kilydd,&rsquo; replied the youth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then my cousin thou art in truth,&rsquo; replied Arthur, &lsquo;and whatsoever boon
      thou mayest ask thou shalt receive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The boon I crave is that thou mayest win for me Olwen, the daughter of
      Yspaddaden Penkawr, and this boon I seek likewise at the hands of thy
      warriors. From Sol, who can stand all day upon one foot; from Ossol, who,
      if he were to find himself on the top of the highest mountain in the
      world, could make it into a level plain in the beat of a bird&rsquo;s wing; from
      Cluse, who, though he were buried under the earth, could yet hear the ant
      leave her nest fifty miles away: from these and from Kai and from Bedwyr
      and from all thy mighty men I crave this boon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O Kilweh,&rsquo; said Arthur, &lsquo;never have I heard of the maiden of whom thou
      speakest, nor of her kindred, but I will send messengers to seek her if
      thou wilt give me time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;From this night to the end of the year right willingly will I grant
      thee,&rsquo; replied Kilweh; but when the end of the year came and the
      messengers returned Kilweh was wroth, and spoke rough words to Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Kai, the boldest of the warriors and the swiftest of foot&mdash;he
      would could pass nine nights without sleep, and nine days beneath the
      water&mdash;that answered him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rash youth that thou art, darest thou speak thus to Arthur? Come with us,
      and we will not part company till we have won that maiden, or till thou
      confess that there is none such in the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Arthur summoned his five best men and bade them go with Kilweh. There
      was Bedwyr the one-handed, Kai&rsquo;s comrade and brother in arms, the swiftest
      man in Britain save Arthur; there was Kynddelig, who knew the paths in a
      land where he had never been as surely as he did those of his own country;
      there was Gwrhyr, that could speak all tongues; and Gwalchmai the son of
      Gwyar, who never returned till he had gained what he sought; and last of
      all there was Menw, who could weave a spell over them so that none might
      see them, while they could see everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      So these seven journeyed together till they reached a vast open plain in
      which was a fair castle. But though it seemed so close it was not until
      the evening of the third day that they really drew near to it, and in
      front of it a flock of sheep was spread, so many in number that there
      seemed no end to them. A shepherd stood on a mound watching over them, and
      by his side was a dog, as large as a horse nine winters old.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whose is this castle, O herdsmen?&rsquo; asked the knights.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stupid are ye truly,&rsquo; answered the herdsman. &lsquo;All the world knows that
      this is the castle of Yspaddaden Penkawr.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And who art thou?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am called Custennin, brother of Yspaddaden, and ill has he treated me.
      And who are you, and what do you here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We come from Arthur the king, to seek Olwen the daughter of Yspaddaden,&rsquo; 
      but at this news the shepherd gave a cry:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O men, be warned and turn back while there is yet time. Others have gone
      on that quest, but none have escaped to tell the tale,&rsquo; and he rose to his
      feet as if to leave them. Then Kilweh held out to him a ring of gold, and
      he tried to put it on his finger, but it was too small, so he placed it in
      his glove, and went home and gave it to his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whence came this ring?&rsquo; asked she, &lsquo;for such good luck is not wont to
      befall thee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man to whom this ring belonged thou shalt see here in the evening,&rsquo; 
      answered the shepherd; &lsquo;he is Kilweh, son of Kilydd, cousin to king
      Arthur, and he has come to seek Olwen.&rsquo; And when the wife heard that she
      knew that Kilweh was her nephew, and her heart yearned after him, half
      with joy at the thought of seeing him, and half with sorrow for the doom
      she feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon they heard steps approaching, and Kai and the rest entered into the
      house and ate and drank. After that the woman opened a chest, and out of
      it came a youth with curling yellow hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a pity to hid him thus,&rsquo; said Gwrhyr, &lsquo;for well I know that he has
      done no evil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three and twenty of my sons has Yspaddaden slain, and I have no more hope
      of saving this one,&rsquo; replied she, and Kai was full of sorrow and answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let him come with me and be my comrade, and he shall never be slain
      unless I am slain also.&rsquo; And so it was agreed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is your errand here?&rsquo; asked the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We seek Olwen the maiden for this youth,&rsquo; answered Kai; &lsquo;does she ever
      come hither so that she may be seen?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She comes every Saturday to wash her hair, and in the vessel where she
      washes she leaves all her rings, and never does she so much as send a
      messenger to fetch them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will she come if she is bidden?&rsquo; asked Kai, pondering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She will come; but unless you pledge me your faith that you will not harm
      her I will not fetch her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We pledge it,&rsquo; said they, and the maiden came.
    </p>
    <p>
      A fair sight was she in a robe of flame-coloured silk, with a collar of
      ruddy gold about her neck, bright with emeralds and rubies. More yellow
      was her head than the flower of the broom, and her skin was whiter than
      the foam of the wave, and fairer were her hands than the blossoms of the
      wood anemone. Four white trefoils sprang up where she trod, and therefore
      was she called Olwen.
    </p>
    <p>
      She entered, and sat down on a bench beside Kilweh, and he spake to her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, maiden, since first I heard thy name I have loved thee&mdash;wilt
      thou not come away with me from this evil place?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I cannot do,&rsquo; answered she, &lsquo;for I have given my word to my father
      not to go without his knowledge, for his life will only last till I am
      betrothed. Whatever is, must be, but this counsel I will give you. Go, and
      ask me of my father, and whatsoever he shall required of thee grant it,
      and thou shalt win me; but if thou deny him anything thou wilt not obtain
      me, and it will be well for thee if thou escape with thy life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All this I promise,&rsquo; said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      So she returned to the castle, and all Arthur&rsquo;s men went after her, and
      entered the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Greeting to thee, Yspaddaden Penkawr,&rsquo; said they. &lsquo;We come to ask thy
      daughter Olwen for Kilweh, son of Kilydd.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come hither to-morrow and I will answer you,&rsquo; replied Yspaddaden Penkawr,
      and as they rose to leave the hall he caught up one of the three poisoned
      darts that lay beside him and flung it in their midst. But Bedwyr saw and
      caught it, and flung it back so hard that it pierced the knee of
      Yspaddaden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A gentle son-in-law, truly!&rsquo; he cried, writhing with pain. &lsquo;I shall ever
      walk the worse for this rudeness. Cursed be the smith who forged it, and
      the anvil on which it was wrought!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That night the men slept in the house of Custennin the herdsman, and the
      next day they proceeded to the castle, and entered the hall, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yspaddaden Penkawr, give us thy daughter and thou shalt keep her dower.
      And unless thou wilt do this we will slay thee.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Her four great grandmothers and her four great grandfathers yet live,&rsquo; 
      answered Yspaddaden Penkawr; &lsquo;it is needful that I take counsel with
      them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be it so; we will go to meat,&rsquo; but as they turned he took up the second
      dart that lay by his side and cast it after them. And Menw caught it, and
      flung it at him, and wounded him in the chest, so that it came out at his
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A gentle son-in-law, truly!&rsquo; cried Yspaddaden, &lsquo;the iron pains me like
      the bite of a horse-leech. Cursed be the hearth whereon it was heated, and
      the smith who formed it!&rsquo; The third day Arthur&rsquo;s men returned to the
      palace into the presence of Yspaddaden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shoot not at me again,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;unless you desire death. But lift up my
      eyebrows, which have fallen over my eyes, that I may see my son-in-law.&rsquo; 
      Then they arose, and as they did so Yspaddaden Penkawr took the third
      poisoned dart and cast it at them. And Kilweh caught it, and flung it
      back, and it passed through his eyeball, and came out on the other side of
      his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A gentle son-in-law, truly! Cursed be the fire in which it was forged and
      the man who fashioned it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Arthur&rsquo;s men came again to the palace and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shoot not at us any more unless thou desirest more pain than even now
      thou hast, but give us thy daughter without more words.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is he that seeks my daughter? Let him come hither so that I may see
      him.&rsquo; And Kilweh sat himself in a chair and spoke face to face with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it thou that seekest my daughter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is I,&rsquo; answered Kilweh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;First give me thy word that thou wilt do nothing towards me that is not
      just, and when thou hast won for me that which I shall ask, then thou
      shalt wed my daughter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I promise right willingly,&rsquo; said Kilweh. &lsquo;Name what thou wilt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seest thou yonder hill? Well, in one day it shall be rooted up and
      ploughed and sown, and the grain shall ripen, and of that wheat I will
      bake the cakes for my daughter&rsquo;s wedding.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be easy for me to compass this, although thou mayest deem it will
      not be easy,&rsquo; answered Kilweh, thinking of Ossol, under whose feet the
      highest mountain became straightway a plain, but Yspaddaden paid no heed,
      and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Seest thou that field yonder? When my daughter was born nine bushels of
      flax were sown therein, and not one blade has sprung up. I require thee to
      sow fresh flax in the ground that my daughter may wear a veil spun from it
      on the day of her wedding.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be easy for me to compass this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Though thou compass this there is that which thou wilt not compass. For
      thou must bring me the basket of Gwyddneu Garanhir which will give meat to
      the whole world. It is for thy wedding feast. Thou must also fetch me the
      drinking-horn that is never empty, and the harp that never ceases to play
      until it is bidden. Also the comb and scissors and razor that lie between
      the two ears of Trwyth the boar, so that I may arrange my hair for the
      wedding. And though thou get this yet there is that which thou wilt not
      get, for Trwyth the boar will not let any man take from him the comb and
      the scissors, unless Drudwyn the whelp hunt him. But no leash in the world
      can hold Drudwyn save the leash of Cant Ewin, and no collar will hold the
      leash except the collar of Canhastyr.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will be easy for me to compass this, though thou mayest think it will
      not be easy,&rsquo; Kilweh answered him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Though thou get all these things yet there is that which thou wilt not
      get. Throughout the world there is none that can hunt with this dog save
      Mabon the son of Modron. He was taken from his mother when three nights
      old, and it is not know where he now is, nor whether he is living or dead,
      and though thou find him yet the boar will never be slain save only with
      the sword of Gwrnach the giant, and if thou obtain it not neither shalt
      thou obtain my daughter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Horses shall I have, and knights from my lord Arthur. And I shall gain
      thy daughter, and thou shalt lose thy life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The speech of Kilweh the son of Kilydd with Yspaddaden Penkawr was ended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Arthur&rsquo;s men set forth, and Kilweh with them, and journeyed till they
      reached the largest castle in the world, and a black man came out to meet
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whence comest thou, O man?&rsquo; asked they, &lsquo;and whose is that castle?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is the castle of Gwrnach the giant, as all the world knows,&rsquo; 
      answered the man, &lsquo;but no guest ever returned thence alive, and none may
      enter the gate except a craftsman, who brings his trade.&rsquo; But little did
      Arthur&rsquo;s men heed his warning, and they went straight to the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Open!&rsquo; cried Gwrhyr.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not open,&rsquo; replied the porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And wherefore?&rsquo; asked Kai.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The knife is in the meat, and the drink is in the horn, and there is
      revelry in the hall of Gwrnach the giant, and save for a craftsman who
      brings his trade the gate will not be opened to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Verily, then, I may enter,&rsquo; said Kai, &lsquo;for there is no better burnisher
      of swords than I.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This will I tell Gwrnach the giant, and I will bring thee his answer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bid the man come before me,&rsquo; cried Gwrnach, when the porter had told his
      tale, &lsquo;for my sword stands much in need of polishing,&rsquo; so Kai passed in
      and saluted Gwrnach the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it true what I hear of thee, that thou canst burnish swords?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is true,&rsquo; answered Kai. Then was the sword of Gwrnach brought to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall it be burnished white or blue?&rsquo; said Kai, taking a whetstone from
      under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As thou wilt,&rsquo; answered the giant, and speedily did Kai polish half the
      sword. The giant marvelled at his skill, and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a wonder that such a man as thou shouldst be without a companion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have a companion, noble sir, but he has no skill in this art.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is his name?&rsquo; asked the giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let the porter go forth, and I will tell him how he may know him. The
      head of his lance will leave its shaft, and draw blood from the wind, and
      descend upon its shaft again.&rsquo; So the porter opened the gate and Bedwyr
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now there was much talk amongst those who remained without when the gate
      closed upon Bedwyr, and Goreu, son of Custennin, prevailed with the
      porter, and he and his companions got in also and hid themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time the whole of the sword was polished, and Kai gave it into the
      hand of Gwrnach the giant, who felt it and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thy work is good; I am content.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then said Kai:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is thy scabbard that hath rusted thy sword; give it to me that I may
      take out the wooden sides of it and put in new ones.&rsquo; And he took the
      scabbard in one hand and the sword in the other, and came and stood behind
      the giant, as if he would have sheathed the sword in the scabbard. But
      with it he struck a blow at the head of the giant, and it rolled from his
      body. After that they despoiled the castle of its gold and jewels, and
      returned, bearing the sword of the giant, to Arthur&rsquo;s court.
    </p>
    <p>
      They told Arthur how they had sped, and they all took counsel together,
      and agreed that they must set out on the quest for Mabon the son of
      Modron, and Gwrhyr, who knew the languages of beasts and of birds, went
      with them. SO they journeyed until they came to the nest of an ousel, and
      Gwrhyr spoke to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me if thou knowest aught of Mabon the son of Modron, who was taken
      when three nights old from between his mother and the wall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And the ousel answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I first came here I was a young bird, and there was a smith&rsquo;s anvil
      in this place. But from that time no work has been done upon it, save that
      every evening I have pecked at it, till now there is not so much as the
      size of a nut remaining thereof. Yet all that time I have never once heard
      of the man you name. Still, there is a race of beasts older than I, and I
      will guide you to them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So the ousel flew before them, till she reached the stag of Redynvre; but
      when they inquired of the stag whether he knew aught of Mabon he shook his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When first I came hither,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;the plain was bare save for one oak
      sapling, which grew up to be an oak with a hundred branches. All that is
      left of that oak is a withered stump, but never once have I heard of the
      man you name. Nevertheless, as you are Arthur&rsquo;s men, I will guide you to
      the place where there is an animal older than I&rsquo;; and the stag ran before
      them till he reached the owl of Cwm Cawlwyd. But when they inquired of the
      owl if he knew aught of Mabon he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When first I came hither,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;the valley was a wooded glen; then a
      race of men came and rooted it up. After that there grew a second wood,
      and then a third, which you see. Look at my wings also&mdash;are they not
      withered stumps? Yet until to-day I have never heard of the man you name.
      Still, I will guide you to the oldest animal in the world, and the one
      that has travelled most, the eagle of Gwern Abbey.&rsquo; And he flew before
      them, as fast as his old wings would carry him, till he reached the eagle
      of Gwern Abbey, but when they inquired of the eagle whether he knew aught
      of Mabon he shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I first came hither,&rsquo; said the eagle, &lsquo;there was a rock here, and
      every evening I pecked at the stars from the top of it. Now, behold, it is
      not even a span high! But only once have I heard of the man you name, and
      that was when I went in search of food as far as Llyn Llyw. I swooped down
      upon a salmon, and struck my claws into him, but he drew me down under
      water till scarcely could I escape him. Then I summoned all my kindred to
      destroy him, but he made peace with me, and I took fifty fish spears from
      his back. Unless he may know something of the man whom you seek I cannot
      tell who may. But I will guide you to the place where he is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So they followed the eagle, who flew before them, though so high was he in
      the sky, it was often hard to mark his flight. At length he stopped above
      a deep pool in a river.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Salmon of Llyn Llyw,&rsquo; he called, &lsquo;I have come to thee with an embassy
      from Arthur to inquire if thou knowest aught concerning Mabon the son of
      Modron.&rsquo; And the salmon answered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As much as I know I will tell thee. With every tide I go up the river,
      till I reach the walls of Gloucester, and there have I found such wrong as
      I never found elsewhere. And that you may see that what I say is true let
      two of you go thither on my shoulders.&rsquo; So Kai and Gwrhyr went upon the
      shoulders of the salmon, and were carried under the walls of the prison,
      from which proceeded the sound of great weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is it that thus laments in this house of stone?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is I, Mabon the son of Modron.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will silver or gold bring thy freedom, or only battle and fighting?&rsquo; 
      asked Gwrhyr again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By fighting alone shall I be set free,&rsquo; said Mabon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they sent a messenger to Arthur to tell him that Mabon was found, and
      he brought all his warriors to the castle of Gloucester and fell fiercely
      upon it; while Kai and Bedwyr went on the shoulders of the salmon to the
      gate of the dungeon, and broke it down and carried away Mabon. And he now
      being free returned home with Arthur.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this, on a certain day, as Gwythyr was walking across a mountain he
      heard a grievous cry, and he hastened towards it. In a little valley he
      saw the heather burning and the fire spreading fast towards the anthill,
      and all the ants were hurrying to and fro, not knowing whither to go.
      Gwythyr had pity on them, and put out the fire, and in gratitude the ants
      brought him the nine bushels of flax seed which Yspaddaden Penkawr
      required of Kilweh. And many of the other marvels were done likewise by
      Arthur and his knights, and at last it came to the fight with Trwyth the
      board, to obtain the comb and the scissors and the razor that lay between
      his ears. But hard was the boar to catch, and fiercely did he fight when
      Arthur&rsquo;s men gave him battle, so that many of them were slain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Up and down the country went Trwyth the boar, and Arthur followed after
      him, till they came to the Severn sea. There three knights caught his feet
      unawares and plunged him into the water, while one snatched the razor from
      him, and another seized the scissors. But before they laid hold of the
      comb he had shaken them all off, and neither man nor horse nor dog could
      reach him till he came to Cornwall, whither Arthur had sworn he should not
      go. Thither Arthur followed after him with his knights, and if it had been
      hard to win the razor and the scissors, the struggle for the comb was
      fiercer still, but at length Arthur prevailed, and the boar was driven
      into the sea. And whether he was drowned or where he went no man knows to
      this day.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end all the marvels were done, and Kilweh set forward, and with him
      Goreu, the son of Custennin, to Yspaddaden Penkawr, bearing in their hands
      the razor, the scissors and the comb, and Yspaddaden Penkawr was shaved by
      Kaw.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is thy daughter mine now?&rsquo; asked Kilweh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is thine,&rsquo; answered Yspaddaden, &lsquo;but it is Arthur and none other who
      has won her for thee. Of my own free will thou shouldst never have had
      her, for now I must lose my life.&rsquo; And as he spake Goreu the son of
      Custennin cut off his head, as if had been ordained, and Arthur&rsquo;s hosts
      returned each man to his own country.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the &lsquo;Mabinogion.&rsquo;

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property

1.B.  &ldquo;Project Gutenberg&rdquo; is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&ldquo;the Foundation&rdquo;

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you

     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, &ldquo;Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.&rdquo;
 
- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &ldquo;Right
of Replacement or Refund&rdquo; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &lsquo;AS-IS&rsquo; WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
